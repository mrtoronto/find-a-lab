In turn, the gut bacteria release metabolites, toxins, and neurohormones that can alter eating behavior and mood. Some bacterial species may encourage dysregulated eating. The gut bacteria may also upregulate stress responsiveness and heighten the risk for depression, which probiotic supplementation may attenuate.

This review aims to elucidate whether the effects of ω-3 PUFAs in lung cancer is supplementary, pharmacological or both. In addition, clinical studies, evidence in cell lines and animal models suggest how ω-3 PUFAs induce anticancer effects. ω-3 PUFAs and their metabolites are suggested to modulate pivotal pathways underlying the progression or complications of lung cancer, indicating that this is a promising field to be explored. Further investigation is still required to analyze the benefits of ω-3 PUFAs as supplementation or pharmacological treatment in lung cancer.']},\n",

The study was designed to study the effects of LEO on cognitive dysfunction induced by Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used APP/PS1 double transgene (APP/PS1) AD mice in the experiment; these mice exhibit significant deficits in synaptic density and hippocampal-dependent spatial related memory. The effects of LEO on learning and memory were examined using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, Novel object recognition test, and correlative indicators, including a neurotransmitter (acetylcholinesterase, AChE), a nerve growth factor (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF), a postsynaptic marker (PSD95), and presynaptic markers (synapsin-1, and synaptophysin), in APP/PS1 mice. Histopathology was performed to estimate the effects of LEO on AD mice. A significantly lowered brain AChE depression in APP/PS1 and wild-type C57BL/6L (WT) mice. PSD95/ Synaptophysin, the index of synaptic density, was noticeably improved in histopathologic changes. Hence, it can be summarized that memory-enhancing activity might be associated with a reduction in the AChE levels and is elevated by BDNF, PSD95, and synaptophysin through enhancing synaptic plasticity.\"]},\n",

In this paper, a novel electrochemical immunosensor with high selectivity and sensitivity for the detection of the depression marker human apolipoprotein A4 (Apo-A4) was successfully constructed using zeolite imidazole ester metal organic skeleton-nitrogen doped graphene composites (ZIF-8@N-Gr). To this end, because of the higher surface area and biocompatibility, ZIF-8 with abundant biomolecular binding sites provided a good microenvironment for effectively immobilizing antigens. ZIF-8@N-Gr presented a flake structure, as the electrode displayed excellent electrical conductivity, which enhanced the electron transfer and significantly amplified the current signal of the immunosensor. More importantly, these immunosensors are capable of assaying human apolipoprotein A4 (Apo-A4) in 100% serum without suffering from any significant biological interference. Under optimized experimental conditions, the sensor was used for the analysis of whole serum samples and presented a wide linear range from 1.47\\xa0×\\xa010']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Bidirectional relationships between inflammation and metabolic dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric illnesses like depression. Metabolic disturbances drive inflammation, which in turn exacerbate metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance. Both inflammatory (e.g. endotoxin, vaccination) and metabolic challenges (e.g. glucose ingestion) have been shown to affect activity and functional connectivity (FC) in brain regions that subserve reward and motor processing. We previously reported relationships between elevated concentrations of endogenous inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and low corticostriatal FC, which correlated with symptoms of anhedonia and motor slowing in major depression (MD). Herein, we examined whether similar relationships were observed between plasma markers related to glucose metabolism (non-fasting concentrations of glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin and resistin) in 42 medically-stable, unmedicated MD outpatients who underwent fMRI. A targeted, hypothesis-driven approach was used to assess FC between seeds in subdivisions of the ventral and dorsal striatum and a region in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VS-vmPFC), which was previously found to correlate with both inflammation and symptoms of anhedonia and motor slowing. Associations between FC and gene expression signatures were also explored. A composite score of all 5 glucose-related markers (with increasing values reflecting higher concentrations) was negatively correlated with both ventral striatum (VS)-vmPFC (r=-0.33, p<0.05) and dorsal caudal putamen (dcP)-vmPFC (r=-0.51, p<0.01) FC, and remained significant after adjusting for covariates including body mass index (p<0.05). Moreover, an interaction between the glucose-related composite score and CRP was observed for these relationships (F[2,33]=4.3, p<0.05) whereby significant correlations between the glucose-related metabolic markers and FC was found only in patients with high plasma CRP (>3 mg/L; r=-0.61 to -0.81, p<0.05). Insulin and resistin were the individual markers most predictive of VS-vmPFC and dcP-mPFC FC, respectively, and insulin, resistin and CRP clustered together and in association with both LV-vmPFC and dcP-vmPFC in principal component analyses. Exploratory whole blood gene expression analyses also confirmed that gene probes negatively associated with FC were enriched for both inflammatory and metabolic pathways (FDR p<0.05). These results provide preliminary evidence that inflammation and metabolic dysfunction contribute jointly to deficits in reward and motor circuits in MD. Future studies using fasting samples and longitudinal and interventional approaches are required to further elucidate the respective contributions of inflammation and metabolic dysfunction to circuits and symptoms relevant to motivation and motor activity, which may have treatment implications for patients with psychiatric illnesses like depression.']},\n",

Depression is a significant type of mood disorder, where patients suffer from pathological disturbances associated with a proinflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype. Presently, the most commonly used antidepressants such as Zoloft and Citalopram can reduce inflammation, but suffer from dangerous side effects without offering specificity toward macrophages. We employed a new strategy for drug repurposing based on the integration of RNA-seq analysis and text mining using deep neural networks. Our system employs a Google semantic AI universal encoder to compute sentences embedding. Sentences similarity is calculated using a sorting function to identify drug compounds. Then sentence relevance is computed using a custom-built convolution differential network. Our system highlighted the NRF2 pathway as a critical drug target to reprogram M1 macrophage response toward an anti-inflammatory profile (M2). Using our approach, we were also able to predict that lipoxygenase inhibitor drug zileuton could modulate NRF2 pathway in vitro. Taken together, our results indicate that reorienting zileuton usage to modulate M1 macrophages could be a novel and safer therapeutic option for treating depression.']},\n",

This paper discusses the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, through beneficial effects on endothelial function and mediators of chronic inflammation and the possibility to treat or preventing these common conditions. We explore possible barriers to this approach, namely the lack of multiple product licences to treat each of these conditions and how these can be overcome by involving the patient in personalised decisions. We also discuss how opportunities are lost by patients with multiple medical conditions being referred to specialists, primarily interested in one specific problem, with little motivation to treat or prevent conditions outside their remit. We explore how these problems might be related to time and financial restraints or simply a lack of awareness of evidence published in journals related to other specialities. As specialists, we often pride ourselves on providing \"personalised\" or \"patient centred\" care, but we can only truly be doing so if we assess the specific needs of the patient across a range of conditions. As part of personalised care in T2DM, we routinely prescribe statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and metformin, often with poor compliance. In this paper we explore whether the licensed daily PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil should be added routinely to this list as it will potentially improve and prevent bothersome symptoms and improve compliance with other medications.']},\n",

Although the role of neuroinflammation in MMD has been studied, the mechanistic interplay between antidepressants, neuroinflammation, and autophagy is yet to be investigated. The present study investigated the effect of melatonin on LPS-induced neuroinflammation, depression, and autophagy impairment. Our results showed that in mice, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment induced depressive-like behaviors and caused autophagy impairment by dysregulating ATG genes. Moreover, LPS-treatment significantly increased the levels of cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6), enhanced NF-ᴋB phosphorylation, caused glial (astrocytes and microglia) cell activation, dysregulated FOXO3a expression, increased the levels of redox signaling molecules such as ROS/TBARs, and altered expression of Nrf2, SOD2, and HO-1. Melatonin treatment significantly abolished the effects of LPS, as demonstrated by improved depressive-like behaviors, normalized autophagy-related gene expression, and reduced levels of cytokines. Further, we investigated the role of autophagy in LPS-induced depressive-like behavior and neuroinflammation using autophagy inhibitors 3-MA and Ly294002. Interestingly, inhibitors treatment significantly abolished and reversed the anti-depressive, pro-autophagy and anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin. The present study concludes that the anti-depressive effects of melatonin in LPS-induced depression might be mediated via autophagy modulation through FOXO3a signaling.']},\n",

During pregnancy, vitamin D homeostasis is influenced by an increase in maternal calcitriol and a substantial increase in maternal Vitamin D Binding Protein concentrations. In the early stages of life, vitamin D is necessary to mediate numerous brain processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and neurotransmission. Furthermore, Vitamin D has a recognized anti-inflammatory activity that normally suppresses inflammation. Increased activation of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and inflammatory responses during pregnancy can affect maternal health and fetal neurodevelopment during and beyond pregnancy. Vitamin D deficiency and maternal stress during pregnancy, including perinatal depression, may both contribute to alter the efficacy of the immune system and modulate its activity. An association between Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and a reduction in fetal brain development has been widely described and correlated with alteration in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. To this regard, a growing body of evidence highlights that low maternal vitamin D dosage during pregnancy has been related to a significantly greater risk to develop schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses in later life. Aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of maternal vitamin D in determining the fetal origins of mental health, with some references to the link between vitamin D levels, inflammatory responses to stress and mental disorders in adult life.']},\n",

Astragalin (AST) is a bioactive flavonoid that possesses an anti-inflammatory property. However, the antidepressant action of astragalin has not been addressed. In this study, we explored the antidepressant effects of astragalin and its underlying mechanism. Our results showed that AST significantly improved the behavioral defects in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model, promoted SIRT1 expression, and decreased the protein levels of NF-κB p65, NLRP3, cleaved capase-1, cleaved IL-1β and cleaved gasdermin D in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry revealed AST mitigated CUMS-induced microglia overactivation. In vitro, AST profoundly increased the cell viability in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) treated BV2 cells, with upregulated SIRT1 expression and downregulated protein levels of nuclear NF-κB p65, NLRP3, cleaved capase-1, and cleaved gasdermin D. Declined cleavage of gasdermin D was observed after AST administration in immunocytochemistry. Nevertheless, the in vivo and in vitro effects of AST were compromised by SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527. These results indicated that AST possessed an antidepressant property, which was dependent on SIRT1 signaling modulated NLRP3 inflammasome deactivation.']},\n",

Anti-thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and surgical thrombectomy are the primary treatments to recanalize occluded vessels and normalize the blood flow in ischemic and peri-ischemic regions. A large majority of stroke patients are refractory to treatment or are not eligible due to the narrow time window of therapeutic efficacy. In recent decades, we have significantly increased our knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that inexorably lead to progressive damage in infarcted and peri-lesional brain areas. As a result, promising neuroprotective targets have been identified and exploited in several stroke models. However, these considerable advances have been unsuccessful in clinical contexts. This lack of clinical translatability and the emerging use of biomaterials in different biomedical disciplines have contributed to developing a new class of biomaterial-based systems for the better control of drug delivery in cerebral disorders. These systems are based on specific polymer formulations structured in nanoparticles and hydrogels that can be administered through different routes and, in general, bring the concentrations of drugs to therapeutic levels for prolonged times. In this review, we first provide the general context of the molecular and cellular mechanisms impaired by cerebral ischemia, highlighting the role of excitotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress, and depolarization waves as the main pathways and targets to promote neuroprotection avoiding neuronal dysfunction. In the second part, we discuss the versatile role played by distinct biomaterials and formats to support the sustained administration of particular compounds to neuroprotect the cerebral tissue at risk of damage.']},\n",

Outcomes measured at Wave 4 included low-grade inflammation (C-reactive protein, CRP), mental health (depression, problematic alcohol use), and academic success (educational attainment). A co-twin control design was utilized which directly compared within-twin differences in the association between conscientiousness and life outcomes. Main effects of between-twin conscientiousness were found such that higher levels of conscientiousness were associated with higher educational attainment, fewer symptoms of depression, and less problematic alcohol use, across all SES groups. An interaction between family SES and within-twin difference in conscientiousness was found for CRP, such that, among twins growing up in lower SES households, the twin with higher levels of conscientiousness had higher levels of CRP.

       "  'abstract': ['The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has increased in recent years. Among existing mental disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD) has emerged as one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting individuals throughout their lives. Currently, MDD affects 15% of adults in the Americas. Over the past 50 years, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and brain stimulation have been used to treat MDD. The most common approach is still pharmacotherapy; however, studies show that about 40% of patients are refractory to existing treatments. Although the monoamine hypothesis has been widely accepted as a molecular mechanism to explain the etiology of depression, its relationship with other biochemical phenomena remains only partially understood. This is the case of the link between MDD and inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Studies have found that depressive patients usually exhibit altered inflammatory markers, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, oxidized mitochondrial DNA, and thus high levels of both central and peripheral reactive oxygen species (ROS). The effect of antidepressants on these events remains unclear. Nevertheless, the effects of ROS on the brain are well known, including lipid peroxidation of neuronal membranes, accumulation of peroxidation products in neurons, protein and DNA damage, reduced antioxidant defenses, apoptosis induction, and neuroinflammation. Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, tocopherols, and coenzyme Q have shown promise in some depressive patients, but without consensus on their efficacy. Hence, this paper provides a review of MDD and its association with inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress and is aimed at thoroughly discussing the putative links between these events, which may contribute to the design and development of new therapeutic approaches for patients.']},\n",

All participants underwent cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography and calcium scoring. Traditional risk factors (RFs) (family history of premature CVD, smoking, overweight\\u200a/\\u200aobesity and abdominal obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, lipids parameters (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides) and lipids-related markers (apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, ApoB\\u200a/\\u200aApoA1 ratio), biomarkers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs CRP], fibrinogen), indicator carbohydrate metabolism (glucose), ankle-brachial index, stress-test, carotid plaques according to ultrasound were evaluated in all pts. Psychological RFs were evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and DS-14 for type D personality.Results All pts were divided into 2 groups according to the CT angiography results: pts in the main group (n=21) had any non-obstructive lesions or calcium score &gt;0, pts in the control group (n=31) had intact coronary arteries. The groups did not differ in age or gender. 26 multiple linear logistic models for any subclinical atherosclerosis were developed based on obtained diagnostic features. Taking into account R-square = 0.344 (p=0.0008), the best fitting model was follows: subclinical coronary atherosclerosis= -1.576 + 0.234 x SCORE ≥5\\u200a% + 0.541 x hs CRP &gt;2 g\\u200a/\\u200al +0.015 x heart rate (bpm) +0.311 family history of premature CVD. The developed algorithm had sensitivity of 63\\u200a% and specificity of 80\\u200a%.Conclusion The created diagnostic model diagnostic model suggests the presence of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in patients with high\\u200a/\\u200avery high CV risk with a high degree of probability. This easy-to-use method can be used in routine clinical practice to improve risk stratification and management choices in high-risk pts.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Beta-thalassemia major patients are treated with repeated blood transfusions, which may cause iron overload, which in turn may induce immune aberrations, and show an increased risk of depression. The aim of the present study is to examine whether repeated blood transfusions, iron overload, and immune-inflammatory responses are associated with depression in children (6-12\\xa0years) with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), iron status (serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, TS%), and serum levels of CCL11, IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α were measured in TDT with (n\\u2009=\\u200954) and without (n\\u2009=\\u200957) a major depression-like episode (MDLE) and in healthy children (n\\u2009=\\u200955). The results show that MDLE due to TDT is associated with a greater number of blood transfusions and increased iron overload and IL-1β levels. Partial least squares path analysis shows that 68.8% of the variance in the CDI score is explained by the number of blood transfusions, iron overload, and increased levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. The latter two cytokines partly mediate the effects of iron overload on the CDI score, while the effects of blood transfusions on the CDI score are partly mediated by iron overload and the path from iron overload to immune activation. Iron overload is also associated with increased IL-10 and lower CCL11 levels, but these alterations are not significantly associated with depression. In conclusion, blood transfusions may be causally related to MDLE in TDT children and their effects are in part mediated by increased iron overload and the consequent immune-inflammatory response. The results suggest that effects of iron overload and its consequences including inflammation and oxidative stress toxicity may cause MDLE. Current treatment modalities with folic acid and vitamin C are insufficient to attenuate iron overload and immune-inflammatory responses and to prevent MDLE in children with TDT.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Accumulating evidence indicates that patients with severe mental disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia present with various alterations of the gut microbiota and increased intestinal permeability. In addition, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and subclinical inflammation have been reported in this group of patients. Although it has been found that the HPA axis dysregulation appears as a consequence of psychosocial stress, especially traumatic life events, the exact mechanisms of this observation remain unclear. Animal model studies have unraveled several mechanisms linking the gut microbiota with the HPA axis dysfunction. Indeed, the gut microbiota can activate the HPA axis through several mediators that cross the blood-brain barrier and include microbial antigens, cytokines and prostaglandins. There is also evidence that various microbial species can affect ileal corticosterone production that may impact the activity of the HPA axis. However, some metabolites released by various microbes, e.g., short-chain fatty acids, can attenuate the HPA axis response. Moreover, several bacteria release neurotransmitters that can directly interact with vagal afferents. It has been postulated that the HPA axis activation can impact the gut microbiota and intestinal permeability. In this article, we discuss various mechanisms linking the gut microbiota with the HPA axis activity and summarize current evidence for a cross-talk between the gut-brain axis and the HPA axis from studies of patients with mood and psychotic disorders. Finally, we show potential clinical implications that can arise from future studies investigating the HPA axis activity with respect to the gut microbiota in severe mental disorders.']},\n",

Collective data from western blots, ELISA, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry experiments showed that PNOC silencing or administration of helicid led to reduced inflammatory factor levels, oxidative stress and expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), along with increased glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression.

However, the mechanisms underlying the association between depression and circadian rhythm remain unclear.

After repeated central lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections, MCP-1, MIP-1β, and RANTES increased in wild type (WT) but not in Per2-deficient mice. In addition, intracerebroventricular injection of RANTES resulted in depression-like behavior, and Met-RANTES, a CCR5 antagonist, could reverse depression-like behavior induced by LPS treatments. These results indicated that the Per2 gene contributes to depression via chemokines, especially RANTES. Furthermore, BMAL1 expression decreased in LPS-treated Per2-deficient mice and BMAL1 could bind to the promoter of Rantes, indicating clock gene can act as a regulator for neuroinflammation.

Currently, neurobiological mechanisms of enhanced retention of aversive memories during depression, and, in particular, their relation to neuroinflammation are unclear. As the association between major depressive disorder and inflammation has been recognized for some time, we aimed to address whether neuroinflammatory changes are involved in enhanced learning of adversity in a depressive state. To study this question, we used a recently described mouse model of enhanced contextual conditioning of aversive memories, the modified forced swim model (modFST). In this model, the classic two-day forced swim is followed by an additional delayed session on Day 5, where increased floating behaviour and upregulated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) are context-dependent. Here, increased time spent floating on Day 5, a parameter of enhanced learning of the adverse context, was accompanied by hypercorticosteronemia, increased gene expression of GSK-3α, GSK-3β, c-Fos, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and elevated concentrations of protein carbonyl, a marker of oxidative stress, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. There were significant correlations between cytokine levels and GSK-3β gene expression. Two-week administration of compounds with antidepressant properties, imipramine (7\\xa0mg/kg/day) or thiamine (vitamin B1; 200\\xa0mg/kg/day) ameliorated most of the modFST-induced changes. Thus, enhanced learning of adverse memories is associated with pro-inflammatory changes that should be considered for optimizing pharmacotherapy of depression associated with enhanced learning of aversive memories.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Background The emerging line of research suggests that neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress are linked to the development of depression-like behavior. The tryptophan metabolizing enzyme, indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), serves as an important interface between chronic inflammation and depression. IDO is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines and diverts tryptophan towards the kynurenine pathway, decreasing serotonin synthesis. Further, the metabolites of kynurenine pathway increase brain oxidative stress and also cause N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated exitotoxicity. The resulting oxidative damage and dysfunction in glutamatergic neurotransmission alters the network connectivity of the brain, which may be the further mechanism for emergence of depression-like symptoms. Methods A depression-like illness was induced in mice by injecting Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) suspended in isotonic saline at a dose of 107 CFU I.P. The mice were then divided into different groups and were administered MK-801 or normal saline for the next 21 days, after which a battery of behavior and biochemical tests were conducted to assess them. Results The BCG group had significantly reduced sucrose preference index and an increase in immobility time in forced swim test (FST) and Tail Suspension Test (TST) as compared to the saline group. There was also a significant increase in the brain MDA levels and a decline in the brain GSH levels. The hippocampal tissue from the BCG group had significantly more comet cells than the saline group. The NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, was able to reverse the BCG-induced depression-like behaviour. MK-801 also showed significant decrease in brain oxidative stress but failed to show significant protection against BCG-induced neurotoxicity observed in comet assay. Conclusions The NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, mitigated BCG-induced, depressive-like behavior in mice by improving the sucrose preference and decreasing the duration of immobility time in TST and FST. The overall improvement in depression-like behavior was accompanied by a reduction in brain oxidative stress and comet cells, thus suggesting the antioxidant and neuroprotective action of MK-801.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Studying comorbidities in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) provides a better understanding of the extended burden of the disease. Depression and anxiety are well recognized but understudied comorbidities in patients with PsA. The prevalence of depression is significantly higher in this patient population than in the general population, with far reaching consequences in terms of long-term quality of life. Over the past few years there has been an increasing interest in the link between inflammation and depression, with several novel studies being conducted. Recent evidence suggests a significant improvement of depression in PsA patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) as compared to conventional DMARDs. Depression in PsA is multidimensional, with recognized phenotypes, including cognitive disorder, alexithymia and anhedonia. The paucity of standardized, validated tools to screen these dimensional phenotypes remains an unmet need. Prevalence studies on depression in patients with PsA, mostly based on patient-reported outcomes, are only able to highlight the tip of the iceberg. A comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach addressing the subdomains of depression is imperative for a better understanding of depression in PsA patients, as well as to find a way forward for improving their quality of life. In this scoping review, we explore existing evidence on the burden of depression in PsA patients, the link between inflammation and depression in these patients and the screening tools used to evaluate the subdomains of depression.']},\n",

The study was a 3 × 3 Latin square using six adult Jersey cows with rumen cannulae, over 9 weeks. In the first 2 weeks of each 3 week experimental period cows were fed with a maintenance diet and, in the last week, each animal was assigned to one of three diets: a control diet (CON), being a continuation of the maintenance diet; a high starch (HSt) or a high sugar (HSu) diet. Reticuloruminal pH and motility were recorded throughout the study period. Blood and ruminal samples were taken on day-1 (TP-1), day-2 (TP-2) and day-7 (TP-7) of each challenge week. Four clinical variables were recorded daily: diarrhoea, inappetence, depression and ruminal tympany. The effects of treatment, hour of day and day after treatment on clinical parameters were analysed using linear mixed effects (LME) models. Although both challenge diets resulted in a decline in pH, an increase in the absolute pH residuals and an increase in the number of minutes per day under pH 5.8, systemic inflammation was only detected with the HSt diet. The challenge diets differentially modified amplitude and period of reticuloruminal contractions compared with CON diet and both were associated with an increased probability of diarrhoea. The HSu diet reduced the probability of an animal consuming its complete allocation. Because the challenge diets were derived from complex natural materials (barley and molasses respectively), it is not possible to assign all the differential effects to the difference in starch and sugar concentration: non-starch components of barley or non-sugar components of molasses might have contributed to some of the observations. In conclusion, substituting much of the starch with sugar caused no substantial reduction in the acidosis load, but inflammatory response was reduced while feed rejection was increased.']},\n",

Relevant comorbidities are cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure, which lead to reduction of vaccine immunogenicity; or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a decline in lung function and a higher risk for pneumonia or infections due to influenza. End-stage renal disease has a high impact on developing infections and causes immune dysfunction over all parts of the immune system. Depression and dementia as well as psychological stress are associated with poor antibody response and a higher range of inflammation markers. Chronic inflammatory processes like rheumatoid arthritis also alter the immune system. In addition, geriatric syndromes and lowered functional status have implications for the vaccination response. Malnutrition is characterized by depletion of structural and functional proteins. This leads to a low antibody response. Negative immunomodulatory effects are also observed in vitamin D insufficiency. Frailty as well is associated with immunological changes and lowered performance in the activities of daily living, but moderate physical activity improves immune function.']},\n",

The administration of EGCG also significantly moderated the expression of caspases 3, 8, and 9 mRNA, which was related to apoptosis in the hippocampus. Furthermore, EGCG also downregulated the expression of STAT3, which was related to the activity of IL-6.

We aimed to explore the linkages of the amygdala-based MR parameters, cognitive and mood performance, systematic inflammation and gut microbiota in ESRD. This prospective study enrolled 28 ESRD patients (13 males and 15 females, mean age of 43.9\\u2009±\\u200913.8\\xa0years) and 19 age- and sex-matched healthy control (HC) (12 males and 7 females, mean age of 44.1\\u2009±\\u200910.0\\xa0years). All subjects underwent cognitive assessment, inflammatory factor and stool microbiota analysis, and brain MRI analysis [amygdala-based functional connectivity and voxel-based morphometry (VBM)]. ERSD was separated by different microbiota strains. All factors were compared between ESRD and HC, as well as between ESRD subgroups. Pearson correlation analysis and causal mediation analysis were conducted to further investigate the relationship among the factors derived from the gut microbiota, brain and systemic inflammation. ESRD displayed gut dysbiosis and increased systemic inflammation when compared to HC (all P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Meanwhile, ESRD showed smaller VBM in amygdala, decreased functional connectivity in left amygdala - right inferior parietal lobe [P\\u2009<\\u20090.05, Gaussian Random Field (GRF) corrected] and worse cognitive or mood performance. Moreover, ESRD-B (Prevutella mainly), when compared to ESRD-A (Bacteroides mainly), displayed increased interleukin-6, self-rating anxiety scale and functional connectivity in left amygdala - bilateral anterior cingulate cortex / medial superior frontal cortex (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05, GRF corrected). Furthermore, the correlation network of ESRD showed that both gut dysbiosis and amygdala-based alteration were correlated with cognitive performance and systemic inflammation. Causal mediation analysis validated that the disrupted distribution of Roseburia indirectly regulated the amygdala-based functional connectivity through tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The gut dysbiosis induced by ESRD was closely related to pro-inflammatory cytokines, amygdala-based phenotype, and mood performance. The lower abundance in Roseburia indirectly modulated amygdala-based functional connectivity pattern by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which might provide a new way in diagnosis and treatment in patients of ESRD with depressive/anxious mood.']},\n",

To ensure a good prognosis, the specialized treatment with the involvement of pediatric rheumatologists is necessary early on, and consideration for transitional medicine is essential.

Behavioral factors such as stress, anxiety, depression and sleep were identified to be associated with other inflammatory skin diseases. Few studies have reported sleep status in rosacea. Aiming to investigate the relationship between rosacea and sleep, a case-control survey was conducted, enrolling 608 rosacea patients and 608 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Sleep quality was assessed through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Diagnosis and severity grading of rosacea were evaluated under the standard guidelines of the National Rosacea Society. More rosacea patients (52.3%, n\\xa0=\\xa0318) suffered poor sleep quality (PSQI, >5) than the healthy controls (24.0%, n\\xa0=\\xa0146), displaying a much higher PSQI score (rosacea vs control, 6.20 vs 3.95). There was a strong association between sleep quality and rosacea (odds ratio [OR], 3.525; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.759-4.519). Moreover, the severity of rosacea was also associated with sleep quality (OR, 1.847; 95% CI, 1.332-2.570). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A and adrenoceptor-β1 genes, which are associated with sleep behaviour, were detected and revealed to be associated with rosacea. Furthermore, the LL-37-induced rosacea-like phenotype and sleep-deprivation mice models were applied, revealing that sleep deprivation aggravated the rosacea-like phenotype in mice, with higher expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9, Toll-like receptor 2, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide and vascular endothelial growth factor. In conclusion, rosacea patients presented poorer\\xa0sleep quality, as well as a higher propability of\\xa0genetic background with sleep disturbance.

However, direct neuropathological evidence of inflammation within the brain tissue remains sparse and the regional distribution of lymphocytes as surrogate markers of blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment has not yet been investigated in this context. Densities of T and B lymphocytes were assessed in coronal whole brain sections of 22 patients with schizophrenia and 20 patients suffering from major depression or bipolar disorder, compared to 20 individuals without neuropsychiatric disorders from the Magdeburg Brain Collection. Cell densities were determined by immunohistochemical staining (anti-CD3 for T cells, anti-CD20 for B cells), followed by automated microscopic image acquisition and analysis. Hierarchical clustering and detailed cluster analysis were performed to detect possible subgroups of patients. Regional distribution was assessed by analysis of color coded mappings based on microsopic scans. Elevated lymphocyte density was found in 7 out of 20 mood disorder patients (adj. p\\xa0=\\xa00.022; Fisher's exact test, FET), 9 out of 22 schizophrenic patients (adj. p\\xa0=\\xa00.014; FET) and in 1 of 20 controls (p\\xa0<\\xa00.005; FET). Several cases showed different patterns of infiltration affecting cortical regions or subcortical white matter, while some presented diffuse infiltration. In two thirds of patients, no increased lymphocyte density could be found. The current findings indicate that lymphocyte infiltration occurs in a greater proportion of schizophrenia and mood disorder patients as compared to healthy controls. Under healthy conditions lymphocytes rarely cross the BBB. Thus, higher densities are considered indicators of neuroinflammation associated with an impairment of the BBB.\"]},\n",

Expanding comprehension of the pathogenesis of depression as an immunometabolic disorder has identified numerous pathophysiologic phenomena in common with CVD, including chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. These shared components could be exploited in order to offer improved alternatives in the joint management of these conditions. Abundant preclinical and clinical data on the impact of established treatments for CVD in the management of depression has allowed for potential candidates to be proposed for the joint management of depression and CVD as immunometabolic disorders. However, a large proportion of the clinical investigation currently available exhibits marked methodological flaws which preclude the formulation of concrete recommendations in many cases. This situation may be a reflection of pervasive problems present in clinical research in psychiatry, especially pertaining study homogeneity. Therefore, further high-quality research is essential in the future in this regard.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['As a new type of conductive material, polyaniline functionalized graphene quantum dots (PAGD), which were prepared by in-situ polymerization had been used to construct a novel electrochemical immunosensor for early screening of depression markers-heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Profiting from the huge specific surface area, good bioactivity and excellent structure of PAGD, a variety of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was firmly loaded on the surface of PAGD for successful construction of basic electrode (HSP70/PAGD/GCE), which was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. Due to the HSP70 fixed on the surface of basic electrode and the HSP70 in the samples can competitively combine with the horseradish peroxidase labeled human HSP70 antibody (HRP-Strept-Biotin-Ab). As a result, there is negative correlation between the concentration of HSP70 in samples and the detection signal of the proposed electrochemical immunosensor (HRP-Strept-Biotin-Ab-HSP70/PAGD/GCE) in the test liquid. Under conditions optimized for determining HSP70, wide linearity was obtained in the range of 0.0976-100\\xa0ng/mL, with a low detection limit of 0.05\\xa0ng/mL at 3σ. Moreover, the proposed electrochemical immunosensors was successfully applied to detect HSP70 in plasma samples, and exhibited good precision, acceptable stability and reproducibility. Therefore, this study provides a novel and convenient method for early clinical screening of depression markers, and also provides a reliable and objective analysis method for the diagnosis of depression at the molecular level.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Viral and bacterial infections causing systemic inflammation are significant risk factors for developing body. Inflammatory processes can alter physiological levels of regulatory factors and interfere with developmental mechanisms. The brain is the main target for the negative impact of inflammatory products during critical ontogenetic periods. Subsequently, the risks of various neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, schizophrenia, and depression are increased in the offspring. Inflammation-induced physiological disturbances can cause immune and behavioral disorders, reproductive deficiencies, and infertility. The influence of maternal immune stress is mediated by the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, leukemia-inhibiting factor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion in the maternal-fetal system. The increasing number of patients with neuronal and reproductive disorders substantiates the identification of biomarkers for these disorders targeted at their therapy.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the levels of chemokines in peripheral blood of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and healthy controls. Meta-analysis was based on random-effects models with Hedges' g as the effect size estimate. We included 13 eligible studies (1221 BD patients and 663 controls). The following chemokines were analysed: interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2 and interferon-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10). The levels of IL-8 (N\\xa0=\\xa08, g\\xa0=\\xa00.26, 95%CI: 0.11-0.41, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), MCP-1 (N\\xa0=\\xa08, g\\xa0=\\xa00.40, 95%CI: 0.18-0.63), eotaxin-1 (N\\xa0=\\xa03, g\\xa0=\\xa00.55, 95%CI: 0.21-0.89, p\\xa0=\\xa00.001) and IP-10 (N\\xa0=\\xa04, g\\xa0=\\xa00.95, 95%CI: 0.67-1.22, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) were significantly higher in BD patients as compared with controls. Subgroup analyses revealed that elevated levels of IL-8 (N\\xa0=\\xa05, g\\xa0=\\xa00.75, 95%CI: 0.42-1.07, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and MCP-1 (N\\xa0=\\xa04, g\\xa0=\\xa00.57, 95%CI: 0.28-0.86, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) appeared only in BD patients during their depressive phase. Illness duration was associated with significantly lower levels of IL-8 in meta-regression analysis. In turn, elevated levels of IP-10 were present during euthymia (N\\xa0=\\xa02, g\\xa0=\\xa00.76, 95%CI: 0.43-1.10, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) but not depression (N\\xa0=\\xa02, g\\xa0=\\xa01.81, 95%CI: -0.16 to 3.77, p\\xa0=\\xa00.072). The analysis of eotaxin-1 levels was mainly based on studies of euthymic BD patients (N\\xa0=\\xa03). Our results suggest that chemokine alterations in BD might be related to mood state. Elevated levels of IL-8 and MCP-1 might be specific to depression. Available evidence indicates that increased levels of eotaxin-1 and IP-10 appear in euthymia; however, more studies are needed to address these alterations in other mood states.\"]},\n",

However, the detailed associations between MBIs and biomarkers in patients with psychiatric disorders remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of MBIs on biomarkers in psychiatric illness used to summarise the effects of low-grade inflammation. A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Effect sizes (ESs) were determined by Hedges' g and the number needed to treat (NNT). Heterogeneity was evaluated. A total of 10 trials with 998 participants were included. MBIs showed significant improvements in the event-related potential amplitudes in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the methylation of serotonin transporter genes in post-traumatic stress disorder, the salivary levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in depression, and the blood levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), IL-6, and TNF-α in generalised anxiety disorder.

Novel therapies are therefore required. It was shown by recent preclinical and clinical studies that a dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission might be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. Furthermore, neuroimmune alterations could have a significant role in the pathogenesis of MDD. Vitamin D is a neurosteroid hormone essential for several metabolic processes, immune responses, and for regulating neurotrophic- neuroprotective processes, neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have also shown a Vitamin D deficiency in patients with severe psychiatric disorders, including MDD. Lately clinical studies have shown the neuroprotective action of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) through a modulation of inflammatory pathways and via the modulation of synaptic release of glutamate in corticosubcortical brain regions the cysteine-glutamate antiporter. This paper reviews the therapeutic use of Vitamin D and NAC and among individuals with refractory MDD to the first- line pharmacological interventions, reviewing the clinical studies published in the last decade. A detail a summary of the current evidence in this area aims to better inform the psychiatrists and general pratictioners on the potential benefits of Vitamin D and NAC supplementation for this disorder. Nutraceutical supplementation with Vitamin D and NAC in treatment resistance MDD may be important not only for improving depressive clinical manifestations, but also for their safety and tolerability profile. This is of great interest especially considering the need of treatment special populations affected by MDD, such as youngsters and elders. Finally, the nutraceutical approach represents a good choice considering its better compliance by the patients compared to traditional psychopharmacological treatment.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Epidemiological evidence indicates the presence of dysregulated homeostatic biological pathways in depressed patients, such as increased inflammation and disrupted energy-regulating neuroendocrine signaling (e.g., leptin, insulin). Alterations in these biological pathways may explain the considerable comorbidity between depression and cardiometabolic conditions (e.g., obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes) and represent a promising target for intervention. This review describes how immunometabolic dysregulations vary as a function of depression heterogeneity by illustrating that such biological dysregulations map more consistently to atypical behavioral symptoms reflecting altered energy intake/expenditure balance (hyperphagia, weight gain, hypersomnia, fatigue, and leaden paralysis) and may moderate the antidepressant effects of standard or novel (e.g., anti-inflammatory) therapeutic approaches. These lines of evidence are integrated in a conceptual model of immunometabolic depression emerging from the clustering of immunometabolic biological dysregulations and specific behavioral symptoms. The review finally elicits questions to be answered by future research and describes how the immunometabolic depression dimension could be used to dissect the heterogeneity of depression and potentially to match subgroups of patients to specific treatments with higher likelihood of clinical success.']},\n",

Besides, previous studies reported reasonable anti-depressant effects for 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone (7, 8 DHF). However, the combination of FLX and 7, 8 DHF in a well-established depression model has not been explored. In this study, we demonstrate that the 7, 8 DHF can improve the anti-depressant efficacy of FLX in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression during the perimenopausal period. The corresponding mechanism of FLX+7, 8 DHF therapy and the effect of ANA-12 are also investigated. Moreover, the influences of 7, 8 DHF (5\\xa0mg/kg/day), FLX (18\\xa0mg/kg/day), and ANA-12 (0.5\\xa0mg/kg/day) on a depressive-like behavior are displayed. Inflammatory, autophagic and apoptotic changes of hippocampus and cortex are examined by using western blot, immunofluorescence, and Real-Time Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) techniques. The protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (p-ErK 1/2)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) of hippocampus and cortex are assessed by western blot. The combined FLX and 7, 8 DHF treatment can significantly improve depressive-like behavior in sucrose preference and forced swimming tests accompanied by a noticeable upregulation of autophagy, neuronal nuclei (NeuN), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) expressions, and PI3K/Akt/ mTOR/ p-ErK 1/2 signaling pathways. Besides, an obvious increase of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB levels are observed with down-regulated inflammation and apoptosis. These findings suggest that the integrated FLX and 7, 8 DHF holds a potential as an efficient treatment to ameliorate depressive-like behavior in perimenopausal patients.']},\n",

Interferon regulatory factor-2 binding protein 2 (IRF2BP2) has been identified as a negative regulator of inflammation, but its role in septic cardiomyopathy is unknown. The current study aims to illuminate the regulatory function of IRF2BP2 on sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Protein expression of IRF2BP2 in response to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy was examined in the heart of mice challenged by LPS intraperitoneal injection. AAV9-delivered IRF2BP2 overexpression in the heart was applied to evaluate the regulatory role of IRF2BP2 in sepsis-induced myocardial depression, inflammatory response, and cell death. The molecular mechanisms underlying IRF2BP2-regulated cardiomyopathy were explored using western blot screening assay. Primary cardiomyocytes have been isolated to further confirm the role and mechanism of IRF2BP2 during septic cardiomyopathy. IRF2BP2 expression was dramatically increased in the heart of mice after LPS administration. AAV9-mediated IRF2BP2 overexpression significantly improved sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine production, and blocked cell death after LPS treatment. Mechanistically, IRF2BP2 activated AMPK signaling in cardiomyocytes, while inhibiting AMPK activation largely reversed IRF2BP2-benefited inflammatory suppression and cell survival. These findings clearly demonstrated that IRF2BP2 is a potent suppressor of sepsis-induced myocardial depression and related heart impairment. Targeting IRF2BP2 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for septic cardiomyopathy.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Patients with schizophrenia exhibit psychomotor deficits that are associated with poor functional outcomes. One pathway that may be associated with psychomotor slowing is inflammation. Inflammatory markers have been shown to be elevated in patients with schizophrenia and are associated with psychomotor deficits in both animal and human studies. Forty-three patients with schizophrenia and 29 healthy controls were recruited and underwent a battery of psychomotor tasks. The following immune measures in peripheral blood were assayed: IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-10, TNF, MCP-1, IL-6sr, IL-1RA, and TNFR2. Generalized linear models were used to determine which immune markers, in addition to their interaction with diagnosis, were associated with performance on the psychomotor tasks. As expected, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated slower performance compared with healthy controls on the finger tapping test (FTT, tested on dominant and non-dominant hands), trail making test (TMT), and symbol coding test (SC). Interactive effects with diagnosis were found for TNF, IL-10, IL-6sr, and TNFR2 for the FTT (dominant), IL-10 and IL-6sr for FTT (non-dominant), TNF and IL-10 for TMT and TNF, IL-10, IL-6sr, TNFR2, and IL-1RA for SC. The results of this study provide evidence that peripheral inflammatory markers contribute to psychomotor slowing in patients with schizophrenia. These data are consistent with a growing literature, demonstrating that inflammation may target the basal ganglia to contribute to psychomotor deficits as is seen in other psychiatric disorders such as depression. These data also indicate that psychomotor speed may be a relevant construct to target in studies of the immune system in schizophrenia.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a serious health problem estimated to affect 350 million people globally. Importantly, MDD has repeatedly emerged as an etiological or prognostic factor in cardiovascular disease (CVD) development, including vascular pathology. Several linking pathomechanisms between MDD and CVD involve abnormal autonomic regulation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction as an early preclinical stage of atherosclerosis. However, the cause of accelerated atherosclerosis in MDD patients remains unclear. Recently, the causal relationships between MDD and mediator (e.g., inflammation and/or endothelial dysfunction), as well as the causal pathways from the mediator to atherosclerosis, were discussed. Specifically, MDD is accompanied by immune dysregulation, resulting in increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α), which could lead to depression-linked abnormalities in brain function. Further, MDD has an adverse effect on endothelial function; for example, circulating markers of endothelial dysfunction (e.g., soluble adhesion molecules, von Willebrand factor) have been linked with depression. Additionally, MDD-linked autonomic dysregulation, which is characterized by disrupted sympathovagal balance associated with excessive circulating catecholamines, can contribute to CVD. Taken together, activated inflammatory response, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation could affect gradual atherosclerosis progression, resulting in a higher risk of developing CVD in MDD. This review focused on the pathomechanisms linking MDD and CVD with respect to neuroimmune regulation, and the description of promising biomarkers, which is important for the early diagnosis and personalized prevention of CVD in major depression.']},\n",

At the genus level, the MDD group had lower levels of Faecalibacterium and other related members of the family Ruminococcaceae, which was also reduced relative to healthy controls. Additionally, the class Gammaproteobacteria and genus Flavonifractor were enriched in participants with MDD. Accordingly, predicted functional differences between the two groups include a reduced abundance of short-chain fatty acid production pathways in the MDD group. We also demonstrated that the magnitude of taxonomic changes was associated with the severity of depressive symptoms in many cases, and that most changes were present regardless of whether depressed participants were taking psychotropic medications. Overall, our results support a link between MDD and lower levels of anti-inflammatory, butyrate-producing bacteria, and may support a connection between the gut microbiota and the chronic, low-grade inflammation often observed in MDD patients.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Various lifestyle factors including physical activity and obesity, stress, sleep, and smoking may modify the risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). In patients with established IBD, these lifestyle factors may significantly impact the natural history and clinical outcomes. Recreational exercise decreases the risk of flare and fatigue in patients with IBD. In contrast, obesity increases the risk of relapse and is associated with higher anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain and higher health care utilization. Obesity also modifies pharmacokinetics of biologic agents unfavorably and is associated with a higher risk of treatment failure. Sleep disturbance is highly prevalent in patients with IBD, independent of disease activity, and increases the risk of relapse and chronic fatigue. Similarly, stress, particularly perceived stress rather than major life events, may trigger symptomatic flare in patients with IBD, although its impact on inflammation is unclear. Cigarette smoking is associated with unfavorable outcomes including the risk of corticosteroid dependence, surgery, and disease progression in patients with Crohn's disease; in contrast, smoking does not significantly impact outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis, although some studies suggest that it may be associated with a lower risk of flare. The effect of alcohol and cannabis use in patients with IBD is inconsistent, with some studies suggesting that cannabis may decrease chronic pain in patients with IBD, without a significant effect of biological remission. Although these lifestyle factors are potentially modifiable, only a few interventional studies have been conducted. Trials of structured exercise and psychological therapy including mindfulness-based therapies such as meditation and yoga and gut-directed hypnotherapy have not consistently demonstrated benefit in clinical and/or endoscopic disease activity in IBD, although may improve overall quality of life.\"]},\n",

This study aimed to examine the association between serum levels of FAM19A5, a novel chemokine-like peptide that reflects reactive astrogliosis and inflammatory activation in the brain, and the neurodegenerative changes of MDD by investigating the correlation between serum FAM19A5 levels and cortical thickness changes in patients with MDD. We included 52 drug-naïve patients with MDD and 60 healthy controls (HCs). Serum FAM19A5 levels were determined in peripheral venous blood samples using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All participants underwent T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging. Serum FAM19A5 levels were greater in patients with MDD than in HCs. In the MDD group, there were significant inverse correlations between serum FAM19A5 levels and cortical thickness in the prefrontal regions (i.e., the left inferior and right medial superior frontal gyri), left posterior cingulate gyrus, right cuneus, and both precunei, which showed significantly reduced thickness in patients with MDD compared to HCs. However, no correlation between serum FAM19A5 level and cortical thickness was observed in the HC group. The results of our study indicate that serum FAM19A5 levels may reflect reactive astrogliosis and related neuroinflammation in MDD. Our findings also suggest that serum FAM19A5 may be a potential biomarker for the neurodegenerative changes of MDD.']},\n",

Recent findings indicate that hypothalamic inflammation is also associated with stress exposure and certain psychiatric diseases, such as depressive disorder. Mechanistic studies have shown that intense and/or chronic stress exposure is accompanied by the synthesis of inflammatory molecules in the hypothalamus, altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and development of glucocorticoid resistance. Consequently, these factors might play a role in the etiopathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. We propose that hypothalamic inflammation represents an interconnection between somatic diseases and depressive disorder. These assumptions are discussed in this mini-review in the light of available data from studies focusing on hypothalamic inflammation.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has received extensive attention for its neuroprotective effect on the brain. This system comprises endocannabinoids, endocannabinoid receptors, and the corresponding ligands and proteins. The molecular players involved in their regulation and metabolism are potential therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric diseases including anxiety, depression and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The inhibitors of two endocannabinoid hydrolases, i.e., fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), have the capacity to increase the level of endocannabinoids indirectly, causing fewer side effects than those associated with direct supplementation of cannabinoids. Their antidepressant and anxiolytic mechanisms are considered to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and regulate synaptic and neural plasticity. In terms of AD/PD, treatment with FAAH/MAGL inhibitors leads to reduction in amyloid β-protein deposition and inhibition of the death of dopamine neurons, which are commonly accepted to underlie the pathogenesis of AD and PD, respectively. Inflammation as the cause of depression/anxiety and PD/AD is also the target of FAAH/MAGL inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the application and involvement of FAAH/MAGL inhibitors in related neurological diseases. Focus on the latest research progress using FAAH/MAGL inhibitors is expected to facilitate the development of novel approaches with therapeutic potential.\"]},\n",

Previous studies typically relied on cumulative risk scores or individual adversities measured through retrospective self-reports. However, these approaches have important limitations. Cumulative risk scores assume equal weighting of adversities and the single adversity approach ignores the high probability that adversities co-occur. In contrast, latent class analysis (LCA) offers an alternative approach to operationalise ACEs that respects the clustering of adversities and may identify specific patterns of ACEs important for health outcomes. Furthermore, prospective and retrospective reports of ACEs show poor agreement. Therefore, it is important to compare findings based on prospective and retrospective measures in the same individuals. Despite an increasing number of studies applying LCA to ACEs data, no studies have yet simultaneously investigated LCA to cumulative risk and single adversity approaches in their relationships with adult inflammation. Identifying the specific ACEs or combinations of ACEs which are strongly related to inflammation is important for investigating the mechanisms involved and the planning of effective interventions.',\n",

Previous studies have produced mixed results regarding the association between depression and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP). The aim of this report was to determine the association between hs-CRP and depression in a large sample of healthy adults. This is a cross-sectional study of 26,638 healthy adults seen for preventive medical examinations between December 2000 and August 2018 at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between hs-CRP levels and depressive symptoms as measured by the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Covariates included race, age, education, smoking history, alcohol use, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), and medication use. The Hs-CRP level demonstrated a weakly positive association with depressive symptoms (OR 1.06 per mg/L, 95%\\u2009CI 1.03 to 1.09 for women; OR 1.05 per mg/L, 95%\\u2009CI 1.02 to 1.09 for men) that became insignificant when controlling for BMI in women (OR 1.02 per mg/L, 95%\\u2009CI 0.98 to 1.05) and men (OR 1.02 per mg/L, 95%\\u2009CI 0.98 to 1.05). Adjusting for antidepressant and statin use did not affect the association between hs-CRP and depressive symptoms in women (OR 0.99 per mg/L, 95%\\u2009CI 0.96 to 1.03) or men (OR 1.01 per mg/L, 95%\\u2009CI 0.97 to 1.05). Levels of hs-CRP were not associated with depression independent of BMI in a predominantly white, male population of higher socioeconomic status. This finding suggests that associations between hs-CRP and depression may be explained by obesity, which warrants further investigation into shared pathways between obesity and depression.']},\n",

We have previously shown that high inflammation as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) in MDD patients is associated with symptoms of anhedonia, a core symptom of MDD, along with deficits in dopaminergic reward circuitry. Increased inflammation can shift metabolic demand and reprogram cellular energy sources, which may collectively impact the brain and reward processing to contribute to symptoms of anhedonia. To determine whether immunometabolic gene signatures were enriched in immune cells of depressed patients with increased inflammation and anhedonia, we examined whole-blood gene expression microarray (Illumina HumanHT-12) data from unmedicated, medically-stable patients with MDD (n\\xa0=\\xa093).

Within patients with High CRP in GSEA, the insulin signaling pathway was the top enriched pathway in patients with High versus Low Anhedonia (n\\xa0=\\xa010 and 9 respectively), which was driven by genes expressed predominantly in monocytes (z\\xa0=\\xa02.95, p\\xa0<\\xa00.01). Conversely, within patients with High Anhedonia, in addition to enrichment of immunometabolic pathways, the tyrosine metabolism pathway was also reduced in patients with High versus Low CRP (n\\xa0=\\xa020 and 10 respectively). Of note, enrichment of immunometabolic pathways was confirmed in complementary linear regression analyses examining pathways associated with a CRP-by-Anhedonia interaction term while controlling for clinical covariates in all patients (n\\xa0=\\xa093). These results indicate that increased glucose and low tyrosine metabolism define a subset of depressed patients with high inflammation and anhedonia. Enrichment of cancer-related pathways driven by metabolic genes also suggests a shift in immune cell metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Together these data suggest that anhedonia in MDD with high CRP involves both immunometabolic shifts and reduced dopamine precursor availability.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and an overactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have both been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. However, these explanations appear contradictory because glucocorticoids are well recognised for their anti-inflammatory effects. Two hypotheses exist to resolve this paradox: the mediating presence of glucocorticoid receptor resistance, or the possibility that glucocorticoids can potentiate inflammatory processes in some circumstances. We sought to investigate these hypotheses in a cell model with significant relevance to depression: human hippocampal progenitor cells. We demonstrated that dexamethasone in vitro given for 24 hours and followed by a 24 hours rest interval before an immune challenge potentiates inflammatory effects in these neural cells, that is, increases the IL-6 protein secretion induced by stimulation with IL-1β (10\\xa0ng/mL for 24\\xa0hours) by\\xa0+\\xa049% (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) at a concentration of 100\\xa0nM and by\\xa0+\\xa070% (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) for 1\\xa0μM. These effects are time- and dose-dependent and require activation of the glucocorticoid receptor. Gene expression microarray assays using Human Gene 2.1st Array Strips demonstrated that glucocorticoid treatment up-regulated several innate immune genes, including chemokines and Nod-like receptor, NLRP6; using transcription factor binding motifs we found limited evidence that glucocorticoid resistance was induced in the cells. Our data suggests a mechanism by which stress may prime the immune system for increased inflammation and suggests that stress and inflammation may be synergistic in the pathogenesis of depression.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of depression remain elusive, and the development of novel, effective antidepressant drugs remains necessary. A dihydroquinoline analog of agomelatine (AGO), N-(2-(7-methoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1-yl)ethyl)acetamide hydrochloride (NMDEA), was synthesized by employing a scaffold-hopping strategy in our previous study. In this study, NMDEA was demonstrated to attenuate depression-related behaviors in mice models of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), using a sucrose preference test, a forced swimming test, and a tail suspension test. However, the antidepressant mechanism of NMDEA appears to differ from that for AGO. Based on the analysis of fecal microbiota from mice, stress can alter the richness of the gut bacterial community, increasing the expression of immune-modulating microbiota, such as Clostridia, and decreasing the expression of probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus. Treatment with NMDEA was able to recover the richness and to regulate the dysbiosis among bacterial species. Several studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiota population can induce inflammatory processes. To explore the effects of NMDEA on the suppression of pro-inflammatory factors, we used Western blotting to analyze the levels of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), p65, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). NMDEA suppressed the activation of IL-1β and IL-6, in the hippocampus, and IL-1β, IL-6, p65, and iNOS, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 cells. These results suggested that NMDEA may affect the microbiota-inflammasome-brain axis, regulating relevant neuro-inflammatory markers and gut microbiota. Our data also suggested that using small molecules to modify the gut microbiota population or alter inflammasome signaling may represent a new therapeutic opportunity for the mitigation of depression.']},\n",

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a member of the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) family, regulates a variety of pharmacological activities, including energy metabolism, glucose and lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. In addition, recent studies showed that the administration of FGF21, a regulator of metabolic function, had therapeutic effects on mood stabilizers, indicating that FGF21 could be a common regulator of the mood response. However, few studies have highlighted the antidepressant effects of FGF21 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mice, and the anti-inflammatory mechanism of FGF21 in depression has not yet been elucidated. The purpose of the current study was to determine the antidepressant effects of recombinant human FGF21 (rhFGF21). The effects of rhFGF21 on depression-like behaviors and the inflammatory signaling pathway were investigated in both an LPS-induced mouse model and primary microglia ']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Inflammation has been identified as one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite the role of inflammation in those conditions, there is still a lack of effective anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) can reduce depressive symptoms and exert anti-inflammatory action putatively by the production of distinct n-3 PUFA-derived metabolites, such as resolvins D (RvD) and E (RvE) series, maresins (MaR) and protectins (PD), which are collectively named specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and act as strong anti-inflammatory agents. In this review we summarize evidence showing the effects of treatment with those metabolites in pre-clinical models of psychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. A total of 25 pre-clinical studies were identified using the PubMed database. Overall, RvD and RvE treatment improved depressive-like behaviors, whereas protectins and maresins ameliorated neurological function. On a cellular level, RvDs increased serotonin levels in a model of depression, and decreased gliosis in neurodegenerative disorders. Protectins prevented neurite and dendrite retraction and apoptosis in models of neurodegeneration, while maresins reduced cell death across all studies. In terms of mechanisms, all SPMs down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Resolvins activated mTOR and MAP/ERK signaling in models of depression, while resolvins and maresins activated the NF-κB pathway in models of neurodegeneration and neurological disorders. Our review indicates a potential promising approach for tailored therapy with n-3 PUFAs-derived metabolites in the treatment of psychiatric, neurodegenerative, and neurological conditions.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Despite established exposure limits and safety standards as well as the availability of carbon monoxide (CO) alarms, each year 50,000 people in the United States visit emergency departments for CO poisoning. Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur from brief exposures to high levels of CO or from longer exposures to lower levels. Common symptoms can include headaches, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, general malaise, and altered mental status. Some patients may have chest pain, shortness of breath, and myocardial ischemia, and may require mechanical ventilation and treatment of shock. Individuals poisoned by CO often develop brain injury manifested by neurological problems, including cognitive sequelae, anxiety and depression, persistent headaches, dizziness, sleep problems, motor weakness, vestibular and balance problems, gaze abnormalities, peripheral neuropathies, hearing loss, tinnitus, Parkinsonian-like syndrome, and other problems. In addition, some will have cardiac issues or other ailments. While breathing oxygen hastens the removal of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) hastens COHb elimination and favorably modulates inflammatory processes instigated by CO poisoning, an effect not observed with breathing normobaric oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen improves mitochondrial function, inhibits lipid peroxidation transiently, impairs leukocyte adhesion to injured microvasculature, and reduces brain inflammation caused by the CO-induced adduct formation of myelin basic protein. Based upon three supportive randomized clinical trials in humans and considerable evidence from animal studies, HBO2 should be considered for all cases of acute symptomatic CO poisoning. Hyperbaric oxygen is indicated for CO poisoning complicated by cyanide poisoning, often concomitantly with smoke inhalation.']},\n",

Pathological mechanisms are still vastly unclear, and current treatments with conventional medications are often unsatisfactory in maintaining symptoms control and an adequate quality of life. Consequently, current research is focusing on shedding new light on disease pathogenesis, to improve therapeutic effectiveness. Recent evidence has suggested a prominent role of inflammation in mood disorders. Elevated levels of peripheral proinflammatory mediators have been reported in BD, as well as in other mood disorders, and people with systemic autoimmune diseases have an increased risk of developing BD. These immunological alterations are stable, and current medications are unable to alter peripheral concentrations even when clinical improvement is evident. These findings have also been replicated in the central nervous system (CNS) milieu, whereas genetic studies have shown that these immune alterations are not due to the disorder itself, being detectable before the illness onset. Moreover, these inflammatory modifications seem to be affected by and linked to other biomarkers of the disorder, such as alterations of white matter (WM) microstructure, metabolism, kynurenine pathway, and circadian rhythmicity. Finally, these immune variations seem to be useful as predictors of therapeutic responsiveness to medications, and in discriminating between clinically different outcomes. The objective of this review is to summarize available evidence on the connection between inflammation and BD, focusing on peripheral inflammatory markers and recent findings on their connection with other typical features of BD, to outline a general overview of the disorder. Moreover, it is meant to analyze the issues with data gathering and interpretation, given the partially contradictory and inconsistent nature of results.']},\n",

MDD has been identified by the World Health Organization as a leading cause of disability worldwide. Approximately 30% of patients are poor responsive to standard of care (SOC) treatment and novel therapeutic approaches are warranted. Since chronic inflammation, as it is often observed in certain cancers, type 2 diabetes, psoriasis and chronic arthritis, are accompanied by depression, it has been suggested that immunoinflammatory processes may be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD. Cytokines are a group of glycoproteins secreted from lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells that orchestrate immune responses. It has been suggested that a dysregulated production of cytokines may be implicated in the pathogenesis and maintenance of MDD. On the basis of their functions, cytokines can be subdivided in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Since abnormal blood and cerebrospinal fluid of both pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines are altered in MDD, it has been suggested that abnormal cytokine homeostasis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD and possibly to induction of therapeutic resistance. We review current data that indicate that cytokines may represent a useful tool to identify MDD patients that may benefit from tailored immunotherapeutic approaches and may represent a potential tailored therapeutic target.']},\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of silymarin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (SM-CS-NPs) on rat model of global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). All rats were randomly distributed into four groups: Control, I/R, SM and SM-CS-NPs. Oral administration of SM and SM-CS-NPs was started 14 days prior to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). Depressive-like behaviors, infarct volume, some oxidative stress markers and inflammatory factors were assessed after induction of I/R. SM-CS-NPs pretreatment significantly ameliorated depressive-like behaviors and infarct volume after I/R. SM-CS-NPs also significantly decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GRx), and glutathione (GSH) levels in I/R brain. The current study demonstrated that SM-CS-NPs pretreatment effectively prevents oxidative and inflammatory damage in the brain caused by I/R, and it can be considered as a useful pretreatment to attenuate the negative effects of I/R.']},\n",

We found that the Bex treatment depressed the increase in the number of activated microglia and astrocytes in the frontal cortex, and the increase in the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in LPS-injected mice. Furthermore, Bex treatment also rescued the decrease in the expression of BDNF, and inhibition of CREB/BDNF/ERK pathway, and improved the expression of synaptic related protein in CORT-induced mice. Based on these results, it is possible that Bex reversed depression-like behaviour in mice by reducing neuroinflammation and protecting against synaptic damage induced by LPS or CORT.\"]},\n",

Moreover, the males showed significant decreases in monoamine neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and dopamine in striatum, and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β in serum. In contrast, females showed persistent loss of weight during stress and displayed significant decreases in sucrose preference after stress. Importantly, the females but not males showed activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with significantly higher levels adrenocorticotropic hormone. Additionally, mRNA level of c-fos and AVP showed there was significant interaction between stress and sex.

       "  'abstract': ['Many patients with cancer suffer from anemia, depression, and an impaired quality of life (QoL). These patients often also show decreased plasma tryptophan levels and increased kynurenine concentrations in parallel with elevated concentrations of Th1 type immune activation marker neopterin. In the course of anti-tumor immune response, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-γ) induces both, the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) to degrade tryptophan and the enzyme GTP-cyclohydrolase I to form neopterin. High neopterin concentrations as well as an increased kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (Kyn/Trp) in the blood of cancer patients are predictive for a worse outcome. Inflammation-mediated tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway is related to fatigue and anemia as well as to depression and a decreased QoL in patients with solid tumors. In fact, enhanced tryptophan breakdown might greatly contribute to the development of anemia, fatigue, and depression in cancer patients. IDO activation and stimulation of the kynurenine pathway exert immune regulatory mechanisms, which may impair anti-tumor immune responses. In addition, tumor cells can degrade tryptophan to weaken immune responses directed against them. High IDO expression in the tumor tissue is associated with a poor prognosis of patients. The efficiency of IDO-inhibitors to inhibit cancer progression is currently tested in combination with established chemotherapies and with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Inflammation-mediated tryptophan catabolism and its possible influence on the development and persistence of anemia, fatigue, and depression in cancer patients are discussed.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are debilitating and chronic in nature, are difficult to treat, and contribute to poor functional outcomes. Motivational deficits are a core negative symptom and may involve alterations in reward processing, which involve subcortical regions such as the basal ganglia. More specifically, dopamine-rich regions like the ventral striatum, have been implicated in these reward-processing deficits. Inflammation is one mechanism that may underlie negative symptoms, and specifically motivational deficits, via the effects of inflammatory cytokines on the basal ganglia. Previous work has demonstrated that inflammatory stimuli decrease neural activity in the ventral striatum and decrease connectivity in reward-relevant neural circuitry. The immune system has been shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be altered in patients with the disorder. This paper reviews the literature on associations between inflammatory markers and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as the role of anti-inflammatory drugs to target negative symptoms. We also review the literature on the role of inflammation and reward processing deficits in both healthy controls and individuals with depression. We use the literature on inflammation and depression as a basis for a model that explores potential mechanisms responsible for inflammation modulating certain aspects of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. This approach may offer novel targets to treat these symptoms of the disorder that are significant barriers to functional recovery and do not respond well to available antipsychotic medications.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"The inflammation process represents of a dynamic series of phenomena that manifest themselves with an intense vascular reaction. Neuroinflammation is a reply from the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) to a changed homeostasis. There are two cell systems that mediate this process: the glia of the CNS and the lymphocites, monocytes, and macrophages of the hematopoietic system. In both the peripheral and central nervous systems, neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and in neuropsychiatric illnesses, such as depression and autism spectrum disorders. The resolution of neuroinflammation is a process that allows for inflamed tissues to return to homeostasis. In this process the important players are represented by lipid mediators. Among the naturally occurring lipid signaling molecules, a prominent role is played by the N-acylethanolamines, namely N-arachidonoylethanolamine and its congener N-palmitoylethanolamine, which is also named palmitoylethanolamide or PEA. PEA possesses a powerful neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory power but has no antioxidant effects per se. For this reason, its co-ultramicronization with the flavonoid luteolin is more efficacious than either molecule alone. Inhibiting or modulating the enzymatic breakdown of PEA represents a complementary therapeutic approach to treating neuroinflammation. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of ultramicronized PEA and co-ultramicronized PEA with luteolin in several neurological diseases using preclinical and clinical approaches.\"]},\n",

However, possible mechanisms remain unclear. Here, a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced model of depression was used to compare EPA and DHA anti-depressant effects. After EPA or DHA feeding, depression-like behavior, brain n-3/n-6 PUFAs profile, serum corticosterone and cholesterol concentration, hippocampal neurotransmitters, microglial and astrocyte related function, as well as neuronal apoptosis and survival signaling pathways were studied. EPA was more effective than DHA to ameliorate CUMS-induced body weight loss, and depression-like behaviors, such as increasing sucrose preference, shortening immobility time and increasing locomotor activity. CUMS-induced corticosterone elevation was reversed by bother fatty acids, while increased cholesterol was only reduced by EPA supplement. Lower hippocampal noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations in CUMS rats were also reversed by both EPA and DHA supplement. However, even though CUMS-induced microglial activation and associated increased IL-1β were inhibited by both EPA and DHA supplement, increased IL-6 and TNF-α levels were only reduced by EPA. Compared to DHA, EPA could improve CUMS-induced suppressive astrocyte biomarkers and associated BDNF-TrkB signaling. Moreover, EPA was more effective than DHA to attenuate CUMS-induced higher hippocampal NGF, GDNF, NF-κB, p38, p75, and bax expressions, but reversed bcl-2 reduction. This study for the first time revealed the mechanisms by which EPA was more powerful than DHA in anti-inflammation, normalizing astrocyte and neurotrophin function and regulating NF-κB, p38 and apoptosis signaling. These findings reveal the different mechanisms of EPA and DHA in clinical depression treatment.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Some recent clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is a key factor that interacts with the three neurobiological correlates of major depressive disorder: depletion of brain serotonin, dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and alteration of the continuous production of adult-generated neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This review discusses the main players in brain immunity as well as how inflammation interacts with the above three mechanisms. It is reported that kynurenine (KYN) pathway alteration in favour of its excitotoxic component and HPA axis dysregulation have the common effect of increasing extracellular glutamate levels and glutamate neurotransmission, which can impact hippocampal neurogenesis. This pathophysiological cascade appears to be triggered or sustained and reinforced by any chronic inflammatory condition involving increased circulating markers of inflammation that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and activate microglia; it can also be the consequence of primary brain neuroinflammation, such as in neurodegenerative disorders with early manifestations that are frequently depressive symptoms. Further recent data indicate that primary microglial activation may also result from a direct impact of chronic stress on vascular function. The intricated dynamic crosstalk between neuroinflammation and other relevant neurobiological correlates of depression add to evidence that neuroinflammation may be a key therapeutic target for future therapeutic strategies in major depressive disorder.']},\n",

Behavioral interventions include exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy, which survivors may be unwilling or unable to adopt.

One potential therapy is the antidepressant bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that targets both inflammation and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

This study compared the effects of partial replacement of fish meal (FM) protein with SBM or Enterococcus faecium fermented SBM (EFSM) on the growth, antioxidant status, intestinal microbiota, morphology, and inflammatory responses in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.). The FM-based diet was used as the control (CONT). Two experimental diets were formulated in which 45% of the FM protein was replaced with SBM or EFSM. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of fish (7.57\\xa0±\\xa00.01\\xa0g) twice daily for 79\\xa0d. Inferior growth performance was observed in SBM group, however, no significant depression was observed in EFSM group compared to the CONT group. The CONT group had the highest values of lysozyme, complement component 3, total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase and catalase, followed by the EFSM group, and the lowest in SBM group. The malondialdehyde content was lowest in the CONT group, followed by the EFSM group, and was highest in the SBM group. Gut morphology showed that SBM diet induced alterations typical for intestinal inflammation including decreased villus and microvillus height, and increased width and inflammatory cell infiltration of the lamina propria. However, the EFSM group alleviated such SBM-induced intestinal pathological disruption. Paralleled with the morphological symptoms, the inflammatory gene expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-8 were highest in the SBM group, followed by the EFSM group, and were lowest in the CONT group. Furthermore, the intestinal microbiota analysis revealed that EFSM group had an overall more similar microbiota with CONT group than SBM group. Specifically, compared with the SBM group, EFSM group significantly enhanced the probiotics Lactobacillus and anti-inflammatory bacterium Faecalibaculum, and inhibited the Vibrio. Collectively, this study indicated that Enterococcus faecium fermentation effectively counteracted the negative effects of SBM by enhancing antioxidant capacity, suppressing inflammatory responses, and modulating gut microbiota in turbot.']},\n",

How non-convulsive neurostimulation interventions impact the neurohormonal and neuroimmune changes that accompany depression remains relatively unknown.

All types of non-convulsive neurostimulation were able to revert the increases in cortisol, ACTH and other components of the HPA axis that are seen in depressed patients, as well as to modulate the levels of key cytokines known to be up-regulated in depression, such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Changes in the HPA axis and levels of cytokines in response to non-convulsive neurostimulation often did not correlate with change in depressive symptoms. Most studies were not controlled trials and thus, significant methodologic variability existed. Furthermore, many human studies lacked a sham stimulation comparator arm. We were unable to conduct relevant meta-analyses due to the design heterogeneities, heterogeneity in the reported outcome measures and the limited number of studies retrieved. Animal studies generally supported the findings of those in human, but again, significant variability in methodology and study design were evident.',\n",

The expressions of miR-1202 and small GTP-ase Rab1a at mRNA level were detected in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation (R) induced human microglial cells (HM cells) by RT-qPCR at different time points within 48 h. Dual luciferase report assay and immunofluorescence staining were performed to confirm whether Rab1a was the potential target of miR-1202. The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) signal related proteins (TLR4, P65, p-P65, IκBa) and the downstream pro-inflammation factors pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, as well as the inflammation factors interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were detected by western-blotting. The expression level of TLR4 on cell surface was detected by flow cytometry. Down-regulation of miR-1202 and up-regulation of Rab1a were found in OGD/R induced HM cells. In addition, miR-1202 was identified to directly target Rab1a and down-regulate its expression. Moreover, over-expression of miR-1202 suppressed the activation of TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway. Rab1a can increase the expression level of TLR4 on the surface of OGD/R induced HM cells. MiR-1202 exerts neuroprotective effect by negatively regulating its target protein Rab1a, which can inactivate TLR4/NF-κB-involved inflammatory signaling pathway in OGD/R induced HM cells.

       "  'abstract': [\"Recently, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and γ isoforms have been gaining consistent interest in neuropathology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Several studies have provided evidence that either the receptor expression or the levels of their endogenously-produced modulators are downregulated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders and in their respective animal models. Remarkably, administration of these endogenous or synthetic ligands improves mood and cognition, suggesting that PPARs may offer a significant pharmacological target to improve several neuropathologies. Furthermore, various neurological and psychiatric disorders reflect sustained levels of systemic inflammation. Hence, the strategy of targeting PPARs for their anti-inflammatory role to improve these disorders is attracting attention. Traditionally, classical antidepressants fail to be effective, specifically in patients with inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exert potent antidepressant effects by acting along with PPARs, thereby strongly substantiating the involvement of these receptors in the mechanisms that lead to development of several neuropathologies. We reviewed running findings in support of a role for PPARs in the treatment of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease or psychiatric disorders, such as major depression. We discuss the opportunity of targeting PPARs as a future pharmacological approach to decrease neuropsychiatric symptoms at the same time that PPAR ligands resolve neuroinflammatory processes.\"]},\n",

Current knowledge of the neurobiology and pathophysiology of these disorders is still modest and clear biological markers are still missing. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms to identify potential therapeutic targets is a prerequisite for the design of new drugs as well as to develop biomarkers that help in a more accurate and earlier diagnosis. Multiple pieces of evidence including genetic and neuro-imaging studies suggest that mood disorders are associated with abnormalities in endoplasmic-reticulum (ER)-related stress responses, mitochondrial function and calcium signalling. Furthermore, deregulation of the innate immune response has been described in patients diagnosed with mood disorders, including depression and BD. These disease-related events are associated with functions localized to a subdomain of the ER, known as Mitochondria-Associated Membranes (MAMs), which are lipid rafts-like domains that connect mitochondria and ER, both physically and biochemically. This review will outline the current understanding of the role of mitochondria and ER dysfunction under pathological brain conditions, particularly in major depressive disorder (MDD) and BD, that support the hypothesis that MAMs can act in these mood disorders as the link connecting ER-related stress response and mitochondrial impairment, as well as a mechanisms behind sterile inflammation arising from deregulation of innate immune responses. The role of MAMs in the pathophysiology of these pathologies and its potential relevance as a potential therapeutic target will be discussed.']},\n",

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals modulate numerous developmental, physiological, and homeostatic processes. The functions of BMPs are also regulated by secreted extracellular antagonists such as chordin and noggin. Chordin has abundant expression in adult brain, and may play critical role in the central nervous system. In this study, the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model of depression, various behavioral tests, western blotting, quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR, immunohistochemistry, recombinant mouse chordin protein and AAV-Chordin-EGFP were together used to explore the role of chordin in the pathogenesis of depression. It was found that CSDS significantly decreased the expression of chordin in the hippocampus but not other related brain regions. Moreover, both pharmacological and genetic overexpression of hippocampal chordin fully protected against the CSDS-induced depressive-like effects in mice. Collectively, hippocampal chordin could be a novel antidepressant target, and this study further highlights the importance of the hippocampal BMP system in the pathophysiology of depression.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['In the pathology-oriented study of depression, inflammation hypothesis has received increasing attention for recent years. To mimic the depressive state caused by inflammation, rodents injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are usually used to stimulate an immune response. However, the dose of LPS that causes depressive-like behavior varies widely across many literatures. Previous study has uncovered the non-linearity in the dose-effect relationship for the depressive-like behavior induced by LPS administration, while the reason for this is still unclear. The present study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this non-linear dose-dependent relationship. Four groups of mice were injected intraperitoneally with different doses of LPS (0, 0.32, 0.8, and 2 mg/kg). The tail suspension test was conducted to evaluate the depressive-like behavior within 23-25 h after the LPS administration. The neuroplasticity was assessed by the levels of related proteins, TrkB and PSD-95, and by the quantification of neurons using Nissl staining. The levels of the two metabolites of the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and kynurenic acid (KYNA), in the brain were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brain were also determined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting, respectively. The results showed that, compared with the control group, the mice in the 0.8 mg/kg LPS-treated group exhibited a remarkable increase of immobility time in the tail suspension test. The neuroplasticity of mice in the 0.8 mg/kg LPS-treated group was also significantly reduced. The neurotoxic metabolite, 3-HK, was accumulated significantly in the hippocampus of the 0.8 mg/kg LPS-treated mice. Surprisingly, the 2 mg/kg LPS-treated mice did not exhibit a remarkable change of 3-HK but expressed increased KYNA significantly, which is neuroprotective. Furthermore, the activation of microglia and astrocytes, which were recognized as the primary source of 3-HK and KYNA, respectively, corresponded to the content of these two metabolites of the KYN pathway in each group. Consequently, it was speculated that the homeostasis of different glial cells could lead to a non-linear dose-dependent behavior by regulating the KYN pathway in the LPS-induced depressive-like mice.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have important roles in the aging process, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other brain disorders. Amyloid beta protein (Aβ) is the main component of amyloid plaques in the brains of people with AD. Several studies suggest that Aβ increases the generation of free radicals in neurons, which leads to oxidative damage and cell death. Aβ can also induce neuroinflammation by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. Walnuts contain several components that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Animal and human studies from our and other groups suggest that supplementation with walnuts in the diet may improve cognition and reduce the risk and/or progression of MCI and AD. In the transgenic AD mouse model (AD-tg), we have reported the beneficial effects of a diet with walnuts on memory, learning, motor coordination, anxiety, and locomotor activity. Human clinical trials have also suggested an association of walnut consumption with better cognitive performance and improvement in memory when compared to baseline in adults. Our recent study in AD-tg mice has shown that a walnut-enriched diet significantly improves antioxidant defense and decreases free radicals' levels, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation when compared to a control diet without walnuts. These findings suggest that a diet with walnuts can reduce oxidative stress by decreasing the generation of free radicals and by boosting antioxidant defense, thus resulting in decreased oxidative damage to lipids and proteins. An in vitro study with synthetic Aβ showed that walnut extract can inhibit Aβ fibrillization and solubilize the preformed Aβ fibrils, suggesting an anti-amyloidogenic property of walnuts. Because it takes many years for cognitive impairment and dementia to develop, we suggest that early and long-term dietary supplementation with walnuts may help to maintain cognitive functions and may reduce the risk of developing, or delay the onset and/or slow the progression of, MCI and dementia by decreasing Aβ fibrillization, reducing oxidative damage, increasing antioxidant defense, and decreasing neuroinflammation. Furthermore, several animal and human studies have suggested that walnuts may also decrease the risk or progression of other brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and depression, as well as of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Together, these reports suggest the benefits of a walnut-enriched diet in brain disorders and in other chronic diseases, due to the additive or synergistic effects of walnut components for protection against oxidative stress and inflammation in these diseases.\"]},\n",

In the current study, high levels of NEAT1 were confirmed in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ALI mice models and in LPS-stimulated cells from the alveolar epithelial A549 cell line. Intriguingly, cessation of NEAT1 led to increased cell viability and decreased lactate dehydrogenase release, apoptosis, and caspase-3/9 activity, which conferred protection against LPS-induced injury in these cells.

In the current climate of increasing obesity and globalization of the Western-style diet, maternal overnutrition emerges as a pressing public health concern. We focus our attention on recent epidemiological and animal model evidence showing that, like psychosocial stress and infection, maternal overnutrition can also increase offspring neuropsychiatric risk. Using lessons learned from the psychosocial stress and infection literature, we discuss how altered maternal and placental physiology in the setting of overnutrition may contribute to abnormal fetal development and resulting neuropsychiatric outcomes. A better understanding of converging pathophysiological pathways shared between stressors may enable development of interventions against neuropsychiatric illnesses that may be beneficial across stressors.']},\n",

Impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with cognitive deficits and depression. Very few studies have investigated the adult hippocampal neurogenesis after pediatric TBI. Here, we evaluated long-term cognition, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and microglial activation in a rabbit pediatric TBI model. On Post-natal Day 5-7 (P5-7), New Zealand white rabbits from the same litter were randomized into naïve, sham (craniotomy alone), and TBI (controlled cortical impact). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50\\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered at 1-month post-injury, once/daily for 5 consecutive days. Novel object recognition and spontaneous alternation in T-maze tests were performed at 2 months post-injury to measure the cognitive functions. The animals were euthanized after behavioral tests at 3 months of age to evaluate adult hippocampal neurogenesis and microglial activation. We found that: 1) pediatric TBI caused significant deficits in hippocampal dependent cognitive functions; 2) the survival rates of adult-born neurons at both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus significantly decreased in the TBI group; 3) TBI induced ectopic migration of adult-born neurons at the dorsal dentate gyrus in both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus; 4) TBI increased astrogenesis in the hilus of the dentate gyrus; and 5) TBI results in abnormal microglial activation. In conclusion, pediatric TBI causes prolonged neuroinflammation and dysregulation of the adult hippocampal neurogenesis through young adulthood, which might be responsible for the cognitive deficits. Protection of adult hippocampal neurogenesis may potentially improve outcomes.']},\n",

The current study was designed to compare the antidepressant effect of\\xa0some antidiabetic drugs such as vildagliptin, pioglitazone, glyburide, and metformin on depression-related or unrelated to type\\xa02 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM was induced by high-fat diet and streptozotocin, while diabetes-unrelated depression was induced by reserpine. Antidiabetic agents reduced diabetes-associated depression as indicated by the reduction in the immobility time in the forced swim test, elevation of cortical and hippocampal serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the increase in serum β-Amyloid 1-42 (Aβ1-42) levels. Antidiabetic agents also reduced serum corticosterone levels suggesting their inhibitory effect on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. The antidepressant activity of the tested compounds was associated with reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation in brain. Vildagliptin showed the highest, while glyburide showed the least antidiabetic and antidepressant activity. Antidepressant activities of pioglitazone and metformin were comparable. The difference in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities between groups showed the same pattern of the antidepressant effect suggesting that these two pathways may play role in ameliorating depression in diabetic rats. On the other hand, the administration of reserpine in small doses (0.2\\xa0mg/kg) induced depression associated with hyperglycemia in non-diabetic rats. Although all treatments improved glycemic parameters to similar levels, vildagliptin showed the greatest effect on Aβ1-42, serotonin, norepinephrine, and BDNF levels. In conclusion, vildagliptin seems to be the leading drug among the tested antidiabetics and may be the most appropriate antidiabetic for managing diabetes-associated depression.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"The endocannabinoid system participates in the regulation of CNS homeostasis and functions, including neurotransmission, cell signaling, inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as neuronal and glial cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. Endocannabinoids are produced by multiple cell types within the CNS and their main receptors, CB1 and CB2, are expressed in both neurons and glia. Signaling through these receptors is implicated in the modulation of neuronal and glial alterations in neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, epilepsy, anxiety and depression. The therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid receptors in neurological disease has been hindered by unwelcome side effects of current drugs used to target them; however, due to their extensive expression within the CNS and their involvement in physiological and pathological process in nervous tissue, they are attractive targets for drug development. The present review highlights the potential applications of the endocannabinoid system for the prevention and treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders.\"]},\n",

Inflammation in depression is a potential target for the development of novel treatment strategies. The present study presents a clinical case in which a patient with an underlying inflammatory condition acutely developed a severe depressive episode resulting in a sudden, dramatic change in their clinical picture. This case, with no similar case reports being in the literature thus far, at least to the best of our knowledge, highlights the increasing consideration that there may be a causative role between neuro-inflammation and depression. This study reports the case of a 40-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and no previous psychiatric history, who developed an acute onset of a severe depressive episode in the context of the immune-mediated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, which the patient had undergone, for the treatment of his ALL. The rapid onset of depression could be explained by the neuroinflammatory processes occurring in GVHD. This provides a clinical example for the possible role of the immune system in depression, and clinicians should be aware of this association.']},\n",

Using placebo data, we examined sex-specific associations between two biomarkers - basal afternoon salivary cortisol and salivary inflammatory cytokines - cognition, and rMDD. Salivary cortisol and inflammatory biomarkers were sampled across the 5 -h study. The panel of inflammatory markers included interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-(TNF)-α, CRP, interferon gamma-induced protein (IP-10), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, monokine induced by interferon (MIG), matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9, and MMP-1. Learning, memory, attention/concentration, and executive function were assessed 30 min and 4 h after the placebo intervention; visuospatial ability was also assessed 30 min after the placebo intervention. For women but not men with HIV, basal cortisol concentrations were higher in rMDD versus noMDD groups, and related to poorer learning and memory. For men and women with HIV, basal inflammatory cytokines were higher in rMDD versus noMDD groups, but were negatively related to cognition independent of rMDD status.

Negative ion treatment belongs to one of the critical categories defined by the National Center for CAM, with such treatment capable of air purification and ameliorating emotional disorders (e.g., depression and seasonal affective disorder). Negative ions can be produced naturally and also by a material with activated energy. Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) often occurs due to inadequate warm up, high-intensity exercise, overload, and inappropriate posture, especially for high-intensive competition. Few studies have investigated the effects of negative ion treatment on muscular injury in the sports science field. In the current study, we enrolled badminton athletes and induced muscle damage in them through eccentric exercise in the form of a high-intensity squat program. We evaluated the effects of negative ion patches of different intensities at three points (preexercise, postexercise, and recovery) by analyzing physiological indexes (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, creatine kinase [CK], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels) and performing a functional assessment (a countermovement jump [CMJ] test). We found that a high-intensity negative ion patch could significantly reduce the levels of TNF-α, an injury-associated inflammatory cytokine, and related markers (CK and LDH). In addition, muscular overload-caused fatigue could be also ameliorated, as indicated by the functional CMJ test result, and related muscular characteristics (tone and stiffness) could be effectively improved. Thus, the negative ion treatment could effectively improve physiological adaption and muscular fatigue recovery after EIMD in the current study. The negative ion patch treatment can be further integrated into a taping system to synergistically fulfill exercise-induced damage protection and functional elevation. However, the effects of this treatment require further experimental validation.']},\n",

It has been postulated that acupuncture may achieve its treatment effects on MDD through suppression of vagal nerve inflammatory responses. Our previous research established that taVNS significantly increases amygdala-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity, which is associated with a reduction in depression severity. However, the relationship between taVNS and the central/peripheral functional state of the immune system, as well as changes in brain neural circuits, have not as yet been elucidated. In the present paper, we outline the anatomic foundation of taVNS and emphasize that it significantly modulates the activity and connectivity of a wide range of neural networks, including the default mode network, executive network, and networks involved in emotional and reward circuits. In addition, we present the inflammatory mechanism of MDD and describe how taVNS inhibits central and peripheral inflammation, which is possibly related to the effectiveness of taVNS in reducing depression severity. Our review suggests a link between the suppression of inflammation and changes in brain regions/circuits post taVNS.']},\n",

Barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier, and innate immunity cells such as microglia, astrocytes, macrophages, and mast cells are involved in triggering disease events in these groups, through the action of many different cytokines. Chronic inflammation can lead to dysfunctions in large-scale brain networks. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, are associated with a substrate of dysregulated immune responses that impair the central nervous system balance. Recent evidence suggests that similar phenomena are involved in psychiatric diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The present review summarizes and discusses the main evidence linking the innate immunological response in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, thus providing insights into how the responses of innate immunity represent a common denominator between diseases belonging to the neurological and psychiatric sphere. Improved knowledge of such immunological aspects could provide the framework for the future development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.\"]},\n",

Despite considerable ambiguity in the directionality and underpinnings of this association, anti-inflammatory drugs are already being tested on mental health patients who present no physical symptoms of inflammation, risking potential adverse side effects. Researchers have thus urgently called for more rigorous empirical elucidations of this association. Based on a large, longitudinal, nationally representative sample of middle-aged adults in the United States (N\\xa0=\\xa01255), IL-6 was observed to be significantly associated with one's present experiencing of depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, IL-6 was predictive of only prospective depressive (not anxiety) symptoms measured six years later, and only when baseline number of symptoms was not accounted for. Further, evidence for IL-6's postulated role as being either a biological cause itself (augmenting HPA stress reactivity) or a biological consequence of a psychological cause (psychological stress) for depression and anxiety was not found. These findings underscore the imperativeness of more rigorous studies to be conducted in this area, and caution practitioners against the premature consideration of IL-6 levels in clinical practice.\"]},\n",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent findings regarding the underlying relationship between CVD and depression. Literature search and review were conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, Wanfang Med Online, and Baidu Scholar databases. CVD and depression are intimately related and researchers from around the world have proposed and validated various mechanisms that may potentially explain the comorbidity of CVD and depression. Recent studies have suggested that depression and CVD may manifest as two distinct clinical conditions in two different organs, the brain and the heart, respectively, but may also be linked by shared mechanisms. Of these, inflammation involving the immune system is thought to be a common mechanism of depression and heart disease, with specific inflammatory cytokines or pathways being potential targets for the prevention and treatment of the concurrent diseases. Therefore, inflammation may play an important role in bridging the link between depression and CVD, a finding that can have important clinical implications for the prevention and early intervention of these conditions.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"The modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis with a view to preventing and treating brain disorders became recently a hot topic for the scientific community. Dietary polyphenols are multifaceted compounds that have demonstrated to be highly advantageous to counteract inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration, among other pathological conditions, being useful in the prevention and treatment of several chronic disorders. The potential of these compounds to prevent and treat brain disorders has not been only related to their capacity to reach the brain, depending on their chemical structure, and interact directly with brain cells, but also to their ability to modulate the communication between the brain and the gut, interfering with multiple branches of this axis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of these food bioactive compounds in brain diseases, namely, neurodevelopmental, such as Down's syndrome and Autism spectrum disorder, neurodegenerative, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Until now, dietary polyphenols have been recognized as promising nutraceuticals to combat brain disorders. However, the impact of these compounds on the gut-brain interconnection remains poorly elucidated. Also, clinical assays are crucial to further support the beneficial effects of these compounds as demonstrated in preclinical research.\"]},\n",

The weight of evidence suggests that induced ketosis reduces levels of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation - core features of the above disorders. There is also data to suggest that induced ketosis may be able to target other molecules and signalling pathways whose levels and or activity are also known to be abnormal in at least some patients suffering from these illnesses such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), increased activity of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (KEAP)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2),Sirtuin-1(SIRT-1) nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 and NAD This review explains the mechanisms by which induced ketosis might reduce mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress in neuropsychiatric disorders and ameliorate abnormal levels of molecules and signalling pathways which also appear to contribute to the pathophysiology of these illnesses.

Unfortunately, patients with nonhealing wounds often suffer from comorbidities that further compound their disability. Given the high rate of depressive symptoms experienced by patients with chronic wounds, further studies are needed to investigate the potentially linked pathophysiological changes in wounds and depression in order to improve patient care. The English literature on wound healing, inflammatory and microbial changes in chronic wounds and depression, and antiinflammatory and probiotic therapy was reviewed on PubMed. Chronic wound conditions and depression were demonstrated to share common pathologic features of dysregulated inflammation and altered microbiome, indicating a possible relationship. Furthermore, alternative treatment strategies such as immune-targeted and probiotic therapy showed promising potential by addressing both pathophysiological pathways. However, many existing studies are limited to a small study population, a cross-sectional design that does not establish temporality, or a wide range of confounding variables in the context of a highly complex and multifactorial disease process. Therefore, additional preclinical studies in suitable wound models, as well as larger clinical cohort studies and trials are necessary to elucidate the relationship between wound microbiome, healing, and depression, and ultimately guide the most effective therapeutic and management plan for chronic wound patients.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Recent evidence suggests that transient ischemia of the brain with reperfusion in humans and animals is associated with the neuronal accumulation of neurotoxic molecules associated with Alzheimer's disease, such as all parts of the amyloid protein precursor and modified tau protein. Pathological changes in the amyloid protein precursor and tau protein at the protein and gene level due to ischemia may lead to dementia of the Alzheimer's disease type after ischemic brain injury. Some studies have demonstrated increased tau protein immunoreactivity in neuronal cells after brain ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recent research has presented many new tau protein functions, such as neural activity control, iron export, protection of genomic DNA integrity, neurogenesis and long-term depression. This review discusses the potential mechanisms of tau protein in the brain after ischemia, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, excitotoxicity, neurological inflammation, endothelium, angiogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, attention was paid to the role of tau protein in damage to the neurovascular unit. Tau protein may be at the intersection of many regulatory mechanisms in the event of major neuropathological changes in ischemic stroke. Data show that brain ischemia activates neuronal changes and death in the hippocampus in a manner dependent on tau protein, thus determining a new and important way to regulate the survival and/or death of post-ischemic neurons. Meanwhile, the association between tau protein and ischemic stroke has not been well discussed. In this review, we aim to update the knowledge about the proteomic and genomic changes in tau protein following ischemia-reperfusion injury and the connection between dysfunctional tau protein and ischemic stroke pathology. Finally we present the positive correlation between tau protein dysfunction and the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease type of neurodegeneration.\"]},\n",

This paper aims to comprehensively review evidence of biological aging in BD and explore findings and controversies related to common biological clocks in patients, including telomere length, DNA methylation, mitochondrial DNA copy number, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Our results suggest a complex interplay between biological markers and a potential key role of environmental factors, such as childhood trauma and psychological stress, in determining premature aging in patients. Moreover, given its multifactorial nature, our summary evidences the need for further studies incorporating clinical evidence with biomarkers of accelerated aging in BD. Results of this review strongly suggest BD as an accelerated aging disease seen in both clinical and molecular aspects. Understanding the pathophysiology of aging in BD may ultimately lead to identification of pathways that can be targeted for prevention of premature aging in patients and early onset of aging-related conditions.']},\n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether simvastatin could improve behavioral disorders, especially depression, anxiety and cognitive function in mouse PD models, and further explore the molecular mechanism. In the present study, C57BL-6 mice underwent intraperitoneal injection of MPTP (30\\xa0mg/kg) once a day for 5 consecutive days. At the same time, simvastatin (10\\xa0mg/kg) was pretreated for 2\\xa0days before the Parkinson's disease model was established, and then continued for 5\\xa0days, and the control group underwent intraperitoneal injection of MK801 (dizocilpine, 0.2\\xa0mg/kg) and saline solution. Depression status was tested by a tail suspension test and a sucrose splash test, followed by an open-field test and an elevated plus maze test to determine anxiety levels. Spatial behavior and muscle status were measured with a water maze and a rotarod test. The expression of RNA and protein of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NMDAR2B), nerve growth factor IB (Nur77), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Our results showed that simvastatin can improve the cognitive function, anxiety, and depression of PD mice with MPTP injury. Simvastatin reversed the NMDAR2B increase, restored Nur77 downward, and reduced the expression of COX-2 and TNF-α in MPTP-treated mice. This role of simvastatin was consistent with MK801 in increasing the expression of Nur77 and inhibiting NMDAR2B and cytokines in MPTP-lesioned PD mice. These findings suggest that reversed the NMDAR2B increase, restored Nur77 downward, and reduced the expression of COX-2 and TNF-α in MPTP-treated mice may be one of the mechanisms that simvastatin improves cognitive functions, depression, and anxiety in MPTP-lesioned mice.\"]},\n",

However, the antidepressant mechanism of SNS has not been clearly elucidated. This study was performed to verify whether the antidepressant effects of SNS were related to its anti-inflammatory effects, the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymatic activity. In our study, behavioral tests such as the forced swim test, sucrose preference test and open-field test were evaluated to ensure the establishment of depressive rats. The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the serum, liver, and hippocampus of rats were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Furthermore, the key proteins NF-κB, BDNF, and TrkB were analyzed by Western blot (WB) analysis in the hippocampus. In addition, CYP450 enzymatic activity analysis was performed using LC-MS/MS in conjunction with drug and statistics (DAS 3.0) after oral administration of six probe drugs. Our results showed that SNS attenuated reserpine-induced increases in IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α expression in the serum, liver, and hippocampus. The levels of NF-κB, BDNF, and TrkB in the hippocampus of depressive rats were also altered. According to the pharmacokinetic parameters, SNS had moderate inhibitory effects in the reserpine-induced depression model on CYP1A2, CYP2D1, CYP2E1, and CYP3A2, but no significant metabolic changes to CYP2C6 and CYP2D2. These findings suggested that SNS has a protective effect on reserpine-induced depressive rats, which may be related to the improvement of the inflammatory factors, the level of BDNF and the activity of CYP450 enzymes.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The accumulating knowledge of the host-microbiota interplay gives rise to the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. The MGB axis depicts the interkingdom communication between the gut microbiota and the brain. This communication process involves the endocrine, immune and neurotransmitters systems. Dysfunction of these systems, along with the presence of gut dysbiosis, have been detected among clinically depressed patients. This implicates the involvement of a maladaptive MGB axis in the pathophysiology of depression. Depression refers to symptoms that characterize major depressive disorder (MDD), a mood disorder with a disease burden that rivals that of heart diseases. The use of probiotics to treat depression has gained attention in recent years, as evidenced by increasing numbers of animal and human studies that have supported the antidepressive efficacy of probiotics. Physiological changes observed in these studies allow for the elucidation of probiotics antidepressive mechanisms, which ultimately aim to restore proper functioning of the MGB axis. However, the understanding of mechanisms does not yet complete the endeavor in applying probiotics to treat MDD. Other challenges remain which include the heterogeneous nature of both the gut microbiota composition and depressive symptoms in the clinical setting. Nevertheless, probiotics offer some advantages over standard pharmaceutical antidepressants, in terms of residual symptoms, side effects and stigma involved. This review outlines antidepressive mechanisms of probiotics based on the currently available literature and discusses therapeutic potentials of probiotics for depression.']},\n",

We investigated whether use of drugs acting on the RAS, as add-on to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), was associated with a reduced risk of psychiatric hospital contacts. We identified all individuals initiating treatment with an SSRI between 1997 and 2012. Individuals using an SSRI without concomitant use of a RAS drug (SSRI-only users) were propensity score matched 1:1 to individuals using both an SSRI and a drug acting on the RAS (SSRI+RAS users). The SSRI-only and SSRI+RAS users were followed for up to three years or until December 31, 2013. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression analyses to calculate risks for psychiatric hospital contacts, hospital contacts due to depression, suicidal behavior, and all-cause mortality. We followed 30,311 SSRI-only users and 30,311 SSRI+RAS users for a total of 49,327 person-years. Compared to SSRI-only users, concomitant use of SSRI+RAS was associated with a significantly reduced risk for psychiatric hospital contacts (hazard rate ratio (HRR)=0.91; 95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI)=0.84-0.98) and lower mortality rate (HRR=0.70; 95%-CI=0.66-0.75).

The present study was conducted among elderly adults from a randomly selected Community in Yangpu District, Shanghai from November 1 to December 30, 2017. 665 participants were included in the present study, including 276 males (median age was 68 years old) and 389 females (median age was 67 years old). NLR was calculated based on results of hematology examination. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the simplified version of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the participant with total score greater than five points was considered to be depressed. The association between NLR and depression was evaluated separately for men and women. The prevalence of depression was 35.1% for men and 34.4% for women. No associations were found between NLR and depression among males. Nevertheless, compared with normal women, NLR was significantly increased in women with depressive symptoms (']},\n",

An ample set of parameters aimed to evaluate cytotoxicity (MTT assay), energy metabolism (HPLC), gene expressions (high-throughput real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)), protein expressions (western blot) and nitric oxide production (qRT-PCR and HPLC), was used to assess the effects of carnosine on activated macrophages challenged with a non cytotoxic LPS (100 ng/mL) + IFN-γ (600 U/mL) concentration. In our experimental model, main carnosine beneficial effects were: (1) the modulation of nitric oxide production and metabolism; (2) the amelioration of the macrophage energy state; (3) the decrease of the expressions of pro-oxidant enzymes (Nox-2, Cox-2) and of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde; (4) the restoration and/or increase of the expressions of antioxidant enzymes (Gpx1, SOD-2 and Cat); (5) the increase of the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and the down-regulation of the expressions of interleukins 1β and 6 (IL-1β and IL-6) and 6) the increase of the expressions of Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1).

Although there is a great wealth of knowledge about the neurobiological processes underlying MM and its symptoms, the mechanisms by which an attack starts during the menstrual cycle remain baffling, and the disease is still undertreated. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize recent data on pathophysiology, epidemiology, burden of disease and treatment of MM. The vast majority of the literature focuses on the relationship between MM and hormonal factors. The role of falling in estrogen levels is believed to increase the susceptibility of blood vessels to prostaglandins, which have been implicated in neurogenic inflammation. Moreover, fluctuations of ovarian steroid hormone levels modulate calcitonin gene-related peptide in the trigeminovascular system. In addition, it has been observed that gonadal hormones modulate cortical spreading depression susceptibility in animal models. Sex hormone influences on MM affect not only the frequency and severity of headache attack but also its treatment. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to neuroendocrine vulnerability in some women and some menstrual cycles may yield possible marker of the disease opening treatment options specifically targeting MM. An increased interest for future research on the subject will further elucidate how to manage this debilitating type of migraine.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Systemic inflammation induces cognitive impairments via unclear mechanisms. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that a subset of neurons that express parvalbumin (PV) play a critical role in regulation of cognitive and emotional behavior. Thus, the aim of the present study was to test whether disruption of PV interneuron mediates systemic inflammation-induced depression-like behavior and working memory impairment by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Here we showed that LPS induces depression-like behavior and working memory impairment, coinciding with increased PV expression, enhanced GABAergic transmission, and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Notably, systemic administration of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine was able to interfere with PV expression and reverse depression-like behavior and working memory impairment, which is probably mediated by reversing impaired LTP.

The specific mechanism of action in migraine is unknown, but it may be related to suppressing inflammation and increasing brain Gamma-aminobutyric acid levels. It also may relate to its ability to suppress cortical spreading depression. Multiple studies have suggested that valproic acid and its derivatives may inhibit Calcitonin gene-related peptide. In the present work, we undertook a small pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of an IV valproate sodium therapy for migraine prevention in a population of patients with chronic migraine refractory to multiple preventive medications.',\n",

To avoid positive selection bias, we evaluated the first admission for valproate IV therapy in patients with multiple admissions; there was 1 patient with 2 admissions and 1 with 3 admissions for IV valproate sodium.

Physician clinical judgment in combination with patient reports were used to assign a dichotomous conclusion on clinical improvement for each patient. In the future, we plan to create a larger study, including additional treatment groups for control, such as IV Dihydroergotamine or IV Chlorpromazine, in order to quantify improvement of symptoms.',\n",

According to Sepsis-3 consensus, the use of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 or more is associated with a higher mortality of sepsis patients. In experimental research, due murine animal model limitations, the use of a score systems can be an alternative to assess sepsis severity. In this work, we suggest a sickness behavior score (SBS) that uses physiological variables to assess sepsis severity and mortality. Animals were evaluated daily by the presence of six indicators of sickness behavior: temperature alteration, preference of water/sucrose, liquid intake, food intake, body weight, and movimentation. Male adult Wistar rats were evaluated daily after sepsis induction by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or laparotomy only (sham) for determination of SBS. Oxidative stress, IL-6, and HPA axis markers (corticosterone and adrenal gland weight) were evaluated 24\\xa0h after CLP to determine the correlation with the acute SBS and neuroinflammation. Also, BDNF and four cognitive behavioral tests were correlated with the chronic SBS, i.e., sum of 8\\xa0days after surgery. In result, septic rats presented higher SBS than sham animals. Sepsis severity markers were associated with acute and chronic SBS. Also, SBS was negative correlated with the cognitive tests. In conclusion, SBS shows to be reliable score to predict sepsis severity and mortality. The use of score system provides the analysis of global sickness behavior, beyond evaluation of each parameter individually.']},\n",

It has been reported that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is often utilized to induce depressive-like behavior in mice with respect to recent studies. However, whether metformin alleviates the symptoms of depressive-like behaviors and its mechanisms remain unexplored. The present study investigates whether metformin alleviates LPS-induced depressive-like behavior in mice and aims to explore the mechanisms. We first treated adult mice with LPS (0.83\\u2009\\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal) to induce depressive-like behavior model for 24\\u2009\\u2009hours after treatment with or without metformin. Then, the effects of metformin on depressive-like behaviors were detected by tail suspension test and forced swim test. Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression levels of lipocalin 2 (Lcn-2) and inflammatory molecules including IL-1β, IL-6 and von Willebrand factor (vWF), which are concerned with inflammation and Lcn-2. It was shown that LPS-induced mouse depressive-like behaviors, as indicated by the increased time of immobility in tail suspension test and forced swim test, were reversed by metformin. It was also shown that LPS increased the mRNA expression levels of Lcn-2 and inflammation-related molecules such as IL-1β in the amygdala tissue, which could be alleviated by metformin. Taken together, metformin mitigates LPS-induced depressive-like behavior in mice by regulating the expression level of Lcn-2 and inflammation-related molecules, including IL-1β, IL-6 and vWF.Video abstract: http://links.lww.com/WNR/A568.']},\n",

Concentrations of CXCL12 and CCL2 were significantly higher in the clinical sample in comparison with controls. A stable multivariate discriminative model between both groups was found. Concentrations of all chemokines decreased after the internet-based psychological intervention. These findings support the implication of chemokines in depression, even in a sample of patients with mild and moderate severity. Furthermore, they demonstrate the need for further multidisciplinary research that confirms how biomarkers such as plasma chemokines can serve as a marker for depression and are sensitive to non-pharmacological interventions.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Chronic inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) is critical to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) that affect the global population. Current therapeutics for NPDs are limited to relieving symptoms and induce many adverse effects. Therefore, the discovery of novel therapeutic agents from natural sources is urgently needed. Intriguingly, the immune responses of peripheral organs are closely linked through the molecular communication between resident and blood-borne cellular components, which shape the neuroinflammatory phenotypes of NPDs. Since the gut and spleen are the two largest immunological organs of the body, the brain-gut-microbiome and brain-spleen axes have been implicated in the connection between the CNS and the peripheral immune system. Accordingly, it has been proposed that the local CNS inflammation observed in NPDs is regulated via the manipulation of the systemic immune system by targeting the gut and spleen. Additionally, the complexity of the signalling network underlying the communication between the CNS and the systemic immune system suggests a strong potential for treating NPDs through a polypharmacological approach. The close association between systemic immunity and the homeostasis of the CNS points to the concept of repurposing interventions for systemic immune disorders to treat NPDs. Notably, natural products represent a promising source of such effective compounds due to both their pharmacological potency and safety. This review discusses the complex implications of dysregulated systemic immunity mediated by the brain-spleen and brain-gut-microbiome axes in NPDs, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. In addition, the potential of repurposing natural product-based bioactive compounds for treating NPDs via modulating systemic immune disorders is intensively discussed.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['This review examines preclinical and clinical studies relevant to our understanding of how the bidirectional gut-brain axis influences the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease. Preclinical studies provide proof of concept that preexisting behavioral illness, such as depression, results in increased susceptibility to inflammatory stimuli and that commonly used classes of antidepressants protect against this vulnerability. However, clinical studies suggesting behavioral illness as a risk factor for IBD and a protective role for antidepressants have relied primarily on symptom-reporting rather than objective measurements of inflammation. In terms of gut-to-brain signaling, there is emerging evidence from preclinical and clinical observation that intestinal inflammation alters brain functions, including the induction of mood disorders, alteration of circadian rhythm both centrally and peripherally, and changes in appetitive behaviors. Furthermore, preclinical studies suggest that effective treatment of intestinal inflammation improves associated behavioral impairment. Taken together, the findings of this review encourage a holistic approach to the management of patients with IBD, accommodating lifestyle issues that include the avoidance of sleep deprivation, optimized nutrition, and the monitoring and appropriate management of behavioral disorders. The review also acknowledges the need for better-designed clinical studies evaluating the impact of behavioral disorders and their treatments on the natural history of IBD, utilizing hard end points to assess changes in the inflammatory process as opposed to reliance on symptom-based assessments. The findings of the review also encourage a better understanding of changes in brain function and circadian rhythm induced by intestinal inflammation.']},\n",

Thus, the possible therapeutic benefits of targeting gut microbiota are being explored for conditions such as stress, depression or schizophrenia. Growing evidence indicates that there is a bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the brain that has an effect on normal CNS functioning and behavioural responses. Alcohol abuse damages the gastrointestinal tract, alters gut microbiota and induces neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. The relationship between alcohol abuse and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, inflammation and immune regulation has been well documented.

If cognitive impairments are not reversed at an early stage of appearance of symptoms, then the prolonged pathogenesis can lead to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, it is necessary to detect the risk factors and mechanism of prevention of cognitive dysfunction at an early stage of disease. Poor lifestyle, age, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation are some of the major risk factors that contribute to cognitive and memory impairments in diabetic patients. Mild cognitive impairment was seen in those individuals of type 2 diabetes, who are on an unhealthy diet. Physical inactivity, frequent alcohol consumptions, and use of packed food products that provides an excess of cheap calories are found associated with cognitive impairment and depression in diabetic patients. Omega fatty acids (FAs) and polyphenol-rich foods, especially flavonoids, can reduce the bad effects of an unhealthy lifestyle; therefore, the consumption of omega FAs and flavonoids may be beneficial in maintaining normal cognitive function. These functional foods may improve cognitive functions by targeting many enzymes and molecules in cells chiefly through their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or signaling actions. Here, we provide the current concepts on the risk factors of cognitive impairments in type 2 diabetes and the mechanism of prevention, using omega FAs and bioactive compounds obtained from fruits and vegetables.

       "  'abstract': ['Depression is common in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and associated with inflammation. Inflammation contributes to the development of CVD and can be modulated by diet. However, the role of inflammatory properties of diet in the relationship between depressive symptoms and CVD risk is not well understood. We hypothesized that the inflammatory properties of diet mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and CVD risk in men and women. Cross-sectional data collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2014) were used for the study. Depressive symptoms scores, inflammatory properties of diet, and CVD risk were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), and the Framingham risk score (FRS), respectively. Generalized linear models were used for the mediation analysis. There were significant differences in the proportions of men and women in the depressed group (PHQ-9\\u202f≥\\u202f10; 5.24\\u202f±\\u202f0.65% vs 9.36\\u202f±\\u202f0.87%, P\\u202f<\\u202f.001) and high CVD risk group (FRS >20%; 16.47\\u202f±\\u202f0.79% vs 6.03\\u202f±\\u202f0.32%, P\\u202f<\\u202f.001). The DII partially mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and CVD risk in men (indirect effect: 0.06, P\\u202f=\\u202f.010) but fully mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and CVD risk in women (indirect effect: 0.10, P\\u202f<\\u202f.001). These findings confirmed our hypothesis that inflammatory properties of diet at least partially mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and CVD risk in men and women. Our findings suggest that interventions designed to reduce depressive symptoms should contain strategies to reduce pro-inflammatory and increase anti-inflammatory properties of diet to decrease CVD risk.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"There is increasing evidence showing that the dynamic changes in the gut microbiota can alter brain physiology and behavior. Cognition was originally thought to be regulated only by the central nervous system. However, it is now becoming clear that many non-nervous system factors, including the gut-resident bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, regulate and influence cognitive dysfunction as well as the process of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular diseases. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors including dietary habits can regulate the composition of the microbiota. Microbes release metabolites and microbiota-derived molecules to further trigger host-derived cytokines and inflammation in the central nervous system, which contribute greatly to the pathogenesis of host brain disorders such as pain, depression, anxiety, autism, Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Change of blood-brain barrier permeability, brain vascular physiology, and brain structure are among the most critical causes of the development of downstream neurological dysfunction.

However, neither the relationship between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) KP metabolites nor their association with inflammatory mediators is well-established in depression. Moreover, the clinical profile associated with combined activation of plasma inflammatory and kynurenine pathways is unknown. Accordingly, plasma and CSF-KP metabolites and inflammatory markers along with depressive symptoms and antidepressant treatment response were measured in 72 unmedicated depressed patients. Following bivariate analyses, component factors representing immune and kynurenine variables in the plasma and CSF were extracted and were used to examine directionality of associations in a path model. In addition, patients were clustered using individual markers that most accounted for the association between plasma immune and KP systems. Path analysis revealed a directional association extending from plasma inflammatory markers to plasma kynurenines, to CSF kynurenines. Among immune markers, plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was robustly associated with plasma kynurenine (KYN) and KYN/tryptophan (TRP), which was in turn significantly associated with CSF KYN, kynurenic acid, and quinolinic acid. Clustering of patients based on plasma TNF and KYN/TRP yielded subgroups of high (N\\u2009=\\u200917) and low (N\\u2009=\\u200955) TNF-KYN/TRP groups. High TNF-KYN/TRP subjects exhibited greater depression severity, anhedonia, and treatment nonresponse. In conclusion, plasma-KP metabolites may mediate an inflammation-associated depressive symptom profile via CNS KP metabolites that can serve as a target for intervention at the level of inflammation, peripheral KYN metabolism, KYN transport to the brain, or effects of KP metabolites on glutamate receptors.']},\n",

Although changes in peripheral inflammatory factors such as Interleukin 18 (IL18), and AD-associated amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides have been linked to depression, a solid relationship between these factors in depressive disorder has yet to be established. This study aims to further determine whether plasma IL18, Aβ40, Aβ42, and the AD-associated tangle component Tau, as well as IL18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be biomarkers for depression.\",\n",
       "   'We measured plasma IL18, Aβ40, Aβ42, and Tau in 64 depressive patients and 75 healthy controls, and characterized genotypes of three IL18 SNPs (rs187238, rs1946518 and rs1946519) in these subjects. Comparisons between depressive patients and controls were carried out in males, in females or in combination. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the correlation between these parameters.',\n",

However, IL18 levels were less in females than in males in healthy people and were significantly increased in female depressive patients compared to female controls. Moreover, IL18 and standardized IL18 were correlated with standardized Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and standardized Tau in depressive patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by relapsing periods of gut inflammation, and is comorbid with depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits. Animal models of IBD that explore the behavioral consequences almost exclusively use acute models of gut inflammation, which fails to recapitulate the cyclic, chronic nature of IBD. This study sought to identify behavioral differences in digging, memory, and stress-coping strategies in mice exposed to one (acute) or three (chronic) cycles of gut inflammation, using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of colitis. Similar levels of gut pathology were observed between acute and chronically exposed mice, although mice in the chronic treatment had significantly shorter colons, suggesting more severe disease. Behavioral measures revealed an unexpected pattern in which chronic treatment evoked fewer deficits than acute treatment. Specifically, acutely-treated mice showed alterations in measures of object burying, novel object recognition, object location memory, and stress-coping (forced swim task). Chronically-treated animals, however, showed similar alterations in object burying, but not the other measures. These data suggest an adaptive or tolerizing effect of repeated cycles of peripheral gut inflammation on mnemonic function and stress-coping, whereas some other behaviors continue to be affected by gut inflammation. We speculate that the normalization of some functions may involve the reversion to the baseline state of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and/or levels of neuroinflammation, which are both activated by the first exposure to the colitic agent.']},\n",

Increasing evidence indicated that microglia activation and inflammatory responses were involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Thus, we desired to induce inflammation-related depressive-like behaviors in mice by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to investigate whether the antidepressant effect of SSd is related to inhibiting inflammation. The results of behavioral tests showed that SSd administration ameliorated LPS-induced depressive-like behaviors, as shown by increased sucrose consumption in the sucrose preference test and decreased immobility time in the tail suspension test and forced swimming test. Furthermore, immunostaining results showed that SSd pretreatment inhibited LPS-induced microglia activation in the hippocampus of mice and primary microglia cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that SSd pretreatment suppressed LPS-induced overexpression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α both in vivo and in vitro. Immunostaining and western blot analysis results demonstrated that SSd pretreatment also inhibited LPS-induced HMGB1 translocation from nuclear to extracellular and decreased the protein levels of TLR4, p-IκB-α, NF-κBp65. These results suggested that SSd effectively improved LPS-induced inflammation-related depressive-like behaviors by inhibiting LPS-induced microglia activation and neuroinflammation, and the possible mechanism might associate with the regulation of the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.']},\n",

However, the underlying mechanism of this treatment maneuver has not been clearly understood. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) procedure was used to establish depression and anxiety-like behavior in rats. The rTMS was performed with a commercially available stimulator for seven consecutive days, and then depression and anxiety-like behaviors were subsequently measured. The expression of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was measured by western-blot, and the level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured with Enzyme-linked immunesorbent assay (ELISA) analyzing kits. Furthermore, a small interfering RNA was employed to knockdown Nrf2, after which the neurobehavioral assessment, Nrf2 nuclear expression, and the amount of inflammation factors were evaluated. Application of rTMS exhibited a significant antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effect, which was associated with the increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation and reduced level of TNF-α, iNOS, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the hippocampus. Following Nrf2 silencing, the antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effect produced by rTMS was abolished. Moreover, the elevated Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and the reduced production of TNF-α, iNOS, IL-1β, and IL-6 in hippocampus mediated by rTMS, were reversed by Nrf2 knockdown. Together, these results reveal that the Nrf2-induced anti-inflammation effect is crucial in regulating antidepressant-related behaviors produced by rTMS.']},\n",

Also, pubertal neuroinflammatory insults can alter neurodevelopment, impact brain functioning in an enduring manner, and contribute to neurological disorders related to brain aging such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and depression. Exposure to probiotics during puberty can mitigate inflammation, reverse dysbiosis and decrease vulnerabilities to brain disorders later in life. The goal of this review is to reveal the consequences of pubertal exposure to stress and immune challenges on the gut microbiota, immune reactivity within the brain and the risk or resilience to stress-induced mental illnesses and neurodegenerative disorders.

In rodent models of sepsis or subchronic immune challenge, memory deficits also persist for weeks or months, even in the absence of ongoing neuroimmune activation. This raises the question of what mechanisms in the brain mediate such persistent changes in neural function. Here, we used RNA-sequencing as a large-scale, unbiased approach to identify changes in hippocampal gene expression long after a subchronic immune challenge previously established to cause persistent memory impairments in both males and females. We observed enduring dysregulation of gene expression three months after the end of a subchronic immune challenge. Surprisingly, there were striking sex differences in both the magnitude of changes and the specific genes and pathways altered, where males showed persistent changes in both immune- and plasticity-related genes three months after immune challenge, whereas females showed few such changes. In contrast, females showed striking differential gene expression in response to a subsequent immune challenge. Thus, immune activation has enduring and sex-specific consequences for hippocampal gene expression and the transcriptional response to subsequent stimuli. Together with findings of long-lasting memory impairments after immune challenge, these data suggest that illnesses can cause enduring vulnerability to, cognitive decline, affective disorders, and memory impairments via dysregulation of transcriptional processes in the brain.']},\n",

PubMed citations for \"microbiome\" are growing at an exponential rate with over 11,000 in 2018. Various microbial taxa have been associated with HIV infection, and some of these taxa associated with HIV infection have also been associated with systemic markers of inflammation in HIV infected individuals. Causality remains unclear however as environmental and behavioral factors may drive HIV risk, inflammation, and gut enterotype. Much of the work currently being done addresses potential mechanisms by which gut microbes influence immune and inflammatory pathways.

RAGE overexpression is associated with diabetic complications, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers. Yet, the molecular mechanism of ligand recognition by RAGE is insufficiently understood to rationalize the binding of diverse ligands. The N-terminal V-type Ig-domain of RAGE contains a triad of tryptophan residue; Trp51, Trp61 and Trp72. The role of these three Trp residues for domain folding, stability and binding of the RAGE ligand S100B was investigated through site-directed mutagenesis, UV/VIS, CD and fluorescence spectrometry, protein-protein interaction studies, and X-ray crystallography. The data show that the Trp triad stabilizes the folded V-domain by maintaining a short helix in the structure. Mutation of any Trp residue increases the structural plasticity of the domain. Residues Trp61 and Trp72 are involved in the binding of S100B, yet they are not strictly required for S100B binding. The crystal structure of the RAGE-derived peptide W72 in complex with S100B showed that Trp72 is deeply buried in a hydrophobic depression on the S100B surface. The studies suggest that multiple binding modes between RAGE and S100B exist and point toward a not previously recognized role of the Trp residues for RAGE-ligand binding. The Trp triad of the V-domain appears to be a suitable target for novel RAGE inhibitors, either in the form of monoclonal antibodies targeting this epitope, or small organic molecules.']},\n",

Inflammatory reactions occur in both liver and spleen, but a series of immune effector genes are downregulated in liver infected with nematodes whereas these genes in spleen from the same fish are upregulated. A series of novel primer and probe sets targeting cod immune responses were developed and applied in a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction set-up to measure the expression of immune-relevant genes in liver and spleen of infected and uninfected cod. In infected liver, 12 of 23 genes were regulated. Genes encoding cytokines associated with inflammatory reactions (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8) were significantly upregulated, whereas genes encoding effector molecules, assisting the elimination of pathogens, C-reactive protein (CRP)-PII, hepcidin, lysozyme G1, lysozyme G2, C3 and IgDm, were significantly downregulated. The number of downregulated genes increased with the parasite burden. In spleen, 14 of 23 immune genes showed significant regulation and nine of these were upregulated, including genes encoding CRPI, CRPII, C3, hepcidin and transferrin. The general gene expression level was higher in spleen compared to liver, and although inflammation was induced in nematode-infected liver, the effector molecule genes were depressed, which suggests a worm-induced immune suppression locally in the liver.']},\n",

Since pharmacological treatments may have substantial side effects, there is a need for complementary treatment options such as specific dietary approaches. Ketone bodies that are produced during fasting diets (FDs) and ketogenic diets (KDs) are an alternative and presumably more efficient energy source for the brain. Studies on mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis showed beneficial effects of KDs and FDs on disease progression, disability, cognition and inflammatory markers. However, clinical evidence on these diets is scarce. In the clinical study protocol presented here, we investigate whether a KD and a FD are superior to a standard diet (SD) in terms of therapeutic effects and disease progression.',\n",

The primary outcome measure is the number of new T2-weighted MRI lesions after 18\\u2009months.

Thirty-three systematic reviews (including 25 meta-analyses) were retrieved encompassing healthy subjects and people with physical health complications. Evidence suggested HIIT improved cardiorespiratory fitness, anthropometric measures, blood glucose and glycaemic control, arterial compliance and vascular function, cardiac function, heart rate, some inflammatory markers, exercise capacity and muscle mass, versus non-active controls. Compared to active controls, HIIT improved cardiorespiratory fitness, some inflammatory markers and muscle structure. Improvements in anxiety and depression were seen compared to pre-training.

Microglia, immune cells of the brain, is thought to be involved in a number of mental disorders, but their role in IBD is largely unknown. In the current work, we investigated whether colitis induced by dextran sulphate sodium (DSS), a murine model of IBD, alters microglial phenotypes in the brain. We found that colitis caused a reduction of Iba-1 and CD68 immunoreactivity, microglial activation markers, in specific brain regions of the limbic system such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), while other areas remained unaffected. Flow cytometry showed an increase of monocyte-derived macrophages during colitis and gene expression analysis in the mPFC showed pronounced changes of microglial markers including cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86), tumour necrosis factor-α, nitric oxide synthase 2, CD206 and chitinase-like protein 3 consistent with both M1 and M2 activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that experimental colitis-induced inflammation is propagated to the brain altering microglial function.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Inflammation has been associated with the progression of many neurological diseases. Peripheral inflammation has also been vaguely linked to depression-like symptoms in animal models, but the underlying pathways that orchestrate inflammation-induced behavioral or molecular changes in the brain are still elusive. We have recently shown that intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to Swiss albino mice triggers systemic inflammation, leading to an activated immune response along with changes in monoamine levels in the brain. Herein we pinpoint the fundamental pathways linking peripheral inflammation and depression-like behavior in a mouse model, thereby identifying suitable targets of intervention to combat the situation. We show that LPS-induced peripheral inflammation provoked a depression-like behavior in mice and a distinct pro-inflammatory bias in the hippocampus, as evident from increased microglial activation and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, and activation of NFκB-p65 pathway. Significant alterations in Nrf2-dependent cellular redox status, coupled with altered autophagy and increased apoptosis were noticed in the hippocampus of LPS-exposed mice. We and others have previously shown that, fluoxetine (an anti-depressant) has effective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties by virtue of its abilities to regulate NFκB and Nrf2 signaling. We observed that treatment with fluoxetine or the Nrf2 activator tBHQ (tert-butyl hydroquinone), could reverse depression-like-symptoms and mitigate alterations in autophagy and cell death pathways in the hippocampus by activating Nrf2-dependent gene expressions. Taken together, the data suggests that systemic inflammation potentiates Nrf2-dependent changes in cell death and autophagy pathway in the hippocampus, eventually leading to major pathologic sequelae associated with depression. Therefore, targeting Nrf2 could be a novel approach in combatting depression and ameliorating its associated pathogenesis.']},\n",

We have previously shown that the bioflavonoid luteolin has pronounced analgesic and antidepressant-like effects in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Here, we further evaluate the biological effect of luteolin as a possible anxiolytic agent in DSS treated mice. Anxiolytic action was evaluated using the open field test (OF), the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and the elevated plus maze test (EPM). Luteolin increased the number of crossings in the center of the OF apparatus, reduced the latency to interact with the food pellet in the NSFT, and increased the time spent in the open arms in the EPM. These results suggest luteolin as a possible natural anxiolytic molecule without sedative effects, thus reinforcing its therapeutic potential for the comorbidities involving peripheral inflammation, pain, mood and anxiety-related disorders.']},\n",

One of the effects of stress is the (over-) activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the release of stress hormones such as glucocorticoids (GCs). Chronically increased stress hormone levels have been shown to have detrimental effects on neuronal networks by inhibiting neurotrophic processes particularly in the hippocampus proper. Centrally, GCs modulate metabolic as well as behavioural processes by activating two classes of corticoid receptors, high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors (GR). Upon activation, GR can modulate gene transcription either as a monomeric protein, or as a dimer interacting directly with DNA. GR can also modulate cellular processes via non-genomic mechanisms, for example via a GPCR-protein interaction. We evaluated the behavioral phenotype in mice with a targeted mutation in the GR in a FVB/NJ background. In GRdim/dim mice, GR proteins form poor homodimers, while the GR monomer remains intact. We evaluated the effect of poor GR dimerization on hippocampus-dependent cognition as well as on exploration and emotional behavior under baseline and chronically increased stress hormone levels. We found that GRdim/dim mice did not behave differently from GRwt/wt littermates under baseline conditions. However, after chronic elevation of stress hormone levels, GRdim/dim mice displayed a significant impairment in hippocampus-dependent memory compared to GRwt/wt mice, which correlated with differential expression of hippocampal Bdnf/TrkB and Fkbp5.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Recent breakthroughs demonstrate that peripheral diseases can trigger inflammation in the brain, causing psychosocial maladies, including depression. While few direct studies have been made, anecdotal reports associate urological disorders with mental dysfunction. Thus, we investigated if insults targeted at the bladder might elicit behavioral alterations. Moreover, the mechanism of neuroinflammation elicited by other peripheral diseases involves the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is present in microglia in the brain and cleaves and activates proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β. Thus, we further explored the importance of NLRP3 in behavioral and neuroinflammatory changes. Here, we used the well-studied cyclophosphamide (CP)-treated rat model. Importantly, CP and its metabolites do not cross the blood-brain barrier or trigger inflammation in the gut, so that any neuroinflammation is likely secondary to bladder injury. We found that CP triggered an increase in inflammasome activity (caspase-1 activity) in the hippocampus but not in the pons. Evans blue extravasation demonstrated breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in the hippocampal region and activated microglia were present in the fascia dentata. Both changes were dependent on NLRP3 activation and prevented with 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium (Mesna), which masks the effects of the CP metabolite acrolein in the urine. Finally, CP-treated rats displayed depressive symptoms that were prevented by NLRP3 inhibition or treatment with Mesna or an antidepressant. Thus, we conclude that CP-induced cystitis causes NLRP3-dependent hippocampal inflammation leading to depression symptoms in rats. This study proposes the first-ever causative explanation of the previously anecdotal link between benign bladder disorders and mood disorders.']},\n",

The aetiologies and time-course of these post-stroke complications have not been extensively studied and are poorly understood. Therefore, we assessed long-term changes in body composition, metabolic markers and behaviour after middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. These outcomes were also studied in the context of obesity, a common stroke co-morbidity proposed to protect against post-stroke weight loss in patients. We found that stroke induced long-term changes in body composition, characterised by a sustained loss of fat mass with a recovery of lean weight loss. These global changes in response to stroke were accompanied by an altered lipid profile (increased plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides) and increased adipokine release at 60\\xa0days. After stroke, the liver also showed histological changes indicative of liver damage and a decrease in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was observed. Stroke induced depression and anxiety-like behaviours in mice, illustrated by deficits in exploration, nest building and burrowing behaviours. When initial infarct volumes were matched between mice with and without comorbid obesity, these outcomes were not drastically altered. Overall, we found that stroke induced long-term changes in depressive/anxiety-like behaviours, and changes in plasma lipids, adipokines and the liver that may impact negatively on future vascular health.']},\n",

There are several classes of anti-diabetic medications that have been developed to normalize blood glucose concentrations through a variety of molecular mechanisms. Beyond glucose-lowering effects, these agents may also provide further therapeutic potential. For instance, there is a high incidence of diabetes-induced neuronal disorders among patients with diabetes, who may also develop neurodegenerative and psychological complications. If anti-diabetic agents can modify the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of neuronal comorbidities, this could potentially be translated to reducing the risk of other neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, memory deficits and cognition impairments among patients with diabetes. This review aimed to shed light on some of the potentially beneficial aspects of anti-diabetic agents in lowering the risk or treating neuronal disorders by reviewing the molecular mechanisms by which these agents can potentially modulate neuronal behaviors.\"]},\n",

The results showed that anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, gut microbiota dysbiosis and changes of SCFAs, and activation of inflammatory reactions in the colon, serum, and hippocampus of CUMS-induced mice, as well as activation of inflammatory reactions in BV2 cells, could be alleviated by the treatment of OP. The mice that were colonized by OP microbiota showed improved anxiety and depressive behaviors and lower inflammatory response. Furthermore, OP inhibited the expression of TLR4, the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and enhanced the MAPKs signaling, these effects of OP also observed in LPS-induced BV2 cells. Above all, suggested that the potential mechanism of the antidepressant-like effects of OP was closely correlated with the bidirectional communication of microbiota-gut-brain axis via regulation of inflammation response.']},\n",

The second is the \"neuronal theory\", which suggests that migraine is triggered by cortical spreading depression. The third is the \"trigemino-vascular theory\", which postulates that migraine is triggered by inflammation of trigeminal nerves and vessels around trigeminal ganglion cells. Nowadays, the \"trigemino-vascular theory\" is widely accepted. However, recent advances in imaging analysis indicate that the origin of migraine lies in a premonitory phase which precedes the aura phase. Modern imaging techniques such as functional MRI and PET reveal high activity of the hypothalamic area during the premonitory phase of migraine. These findings suggest that hypothalamic activation might be a generator of a migraine attack. On the other hand, current analyses show that the photosensitivity of migraine (photophobia) could be caused by dysfunction of the newly discovered intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). In the absence of visual signaling from rods and cones, light activation of ipRGCs expressing melanopsin photopigment is sufficient to produce photophobia during migraine.

It is believed that agents that influence cytokines, immunological signal pathways and cytokine syntheses, like the inhibitors of cyclooxygenase enzyme and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are very important in the potential treatment of residual symptoms of depression. Treatment with cytokine antagonists is one of the potential adjuvant therapies, along with antidepressants. Signal pathways blockers, such as the inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and other NSAIDs, are in the phase of research, in terms of their antidepressant effects. Also, it has been shown that the inhibition of indolamin-2,3 deoxygenase (IDO) and kynurenine (KYN) signal pathways in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, by application of IDO antagonists, are leading to suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine effects. Antidepressants may have anti-inflammatory effects, depending on dose and type, and they achieve this effect through the decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Also, antidepressants modulate the humoral and cellular immune system. This work aims to summarise certain neurobiological and neuroimmunological specificities that have been observed in patients with depression, antidepressants and immunomodulation agents. The understanding of complex and heterogenic pathophysiology of depression through the prism of the altered immune system, is of major importance, in terms of better optimisation of pharmacotherapy, and options for a personalised approach in depressive disorder treatment.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['A 61-year-old woman was referred to our department with a 11-year-erythra. In the anterior tibia of both lower extremities, we could see large dark red infiltrating erythema, waxy luster, clear boundary, slight central atrophy, depression and capillary dilatation. He was diagnosed with \"dermatitis contusiformis\" in local hospitals, but the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine and external drugs was not effective. She had normal laboratory findings for blood routine test, biochemical indexes, C reactive protein(CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR)．Furthermore, autoimmune antibodies were all negative. The skin pathology showed degeneration and necrosis of collagen fibers, chronic granulomatous inflammation in the dermis, and there were more acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration around the small vessels and in the wall of the tube. We eventually diagnosed it as necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) according to the history, erythra morphology and skin pathology. After treatment of low dose hormone and thalidomide for 1 year, the color and range of skin lesions gradually alleviated. NL was a rare chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease. There appeared to be a predominance in females. The incidence of NL was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus, although this asscoiation was currently questioned. NL might also be connected with autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn\\'s disease. The pathological changes of the tissue were mainly in the dermis, including necrotic type, granulomatous type or mixed type. NL typically presented on the pretibial surface of lower extremities. Less typical locations included the face, scalp, vulva and upper limbs. Leisions usually began with small papules and nodules that gradually infiltrated into brown\\ue011yellow patches and developed central wax-like atrophy. The diagnosis is often based on clinical examination and skin biopsy. NL is rare and easy to be misdiagnosed. For rheumatologists, we should carefully compare with the nodular erythema, the microscopic polyangitis and allergic purpura. It is significant for differential diagnosis to perform skin biopsy. Lacking of randomized controlled trials, no specific treatment has proven to be the gold standard. First-line therapy mainly consists of intralesional and systemic corticosteriods. Additionally, other reported treatment options include immunomodulator, biological agent, antiplatelet aggregation drug and platelet\\ue011rich plasma. These patients need long term follow up continuously for progression of the disease, ulcerations, and possibility of malignant tranformation.']},\n",

This vulnerable subgroup may be characterized by a history of childhood trauma. In a single-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover study, 21 women with remitted recurrent MDD and 18 healthy controls were exposed to psychosocial stress (Trier social stress test) or inflammatory stress (typhoid vaccine), or both, to investigate the effects of childhood trauma on the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses. Childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and participants were dichotomized into a traumatized and non-traumatized group. Serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured at regular intervals after each intervention. The effects of trauma, time, and intervention on these parameters were modeled by fitting linear mixed models. Childhood trauma in itself did not have a main effect on the outcome measurements. However, an interactional effect of trauma with stressor type was found in the remitted MDD group: trauma was associated with higher cortisol levels only after adding immunological to psychosocial stress, and with lower TNF-α levels in response to vaccination. This suggests the existence of a vulnerable trauma-associated MDD endophenotype.']},\n",

The changes in cognitive function were evaluated pre- and post-radiation against the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessement (MoCA), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). The changes in inflammatory factors, such as TGF-β1, TNF-α and IL-10, were also detected before, during and after radiation (15Gy/5F). The results showed that 6 months after cranial radiation, the total scores on the MMSE and MoCA scales of the patients decreased, especially memory ability. The control group experienced a more evident decline, the memory ability being the greatest. TGF-β1 and TNF-a increased shortly after radiation and decreased one month later, and the change was more conspicuous in SFI group than in control group. IL-10 increased after radiation and stayed at a high level one month later in both groups, the level being higher in the SFI group than in the control group.

In FM, neurotransmission and glial activation can occur with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and involvement of mast cells (MCs) in the skin. FM skin biopsies show an increase in the number of MCs, as well as the production of corticotropin releasing hormone and substance P (SP) by the neurons, which in turn activate MCs to release neurosensitizing proinflammatory substances, such as cytokines, secreted preformed mediators, and lipids, which can exacerbate low-grade inflammation. In fact, certain proinflammatory cytokines are higher in FM and mediate muscle pain, the mechanism of which is not yet clear. MC-derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces nerve growth factor (NGF) and participates in nerve fiber elongation in skin hypersensitivity. IL-37 is an inhibitor of proinflammatory IL-1 family members, which are generated and released by MCs. The goal of this article is to demonstrate that inflammatory cytokines and MC products play a role in FM and that inflammation may be inhibited by IL-37. Here, we propose IL-37 as a cytokine that contributes to improve the pathogenesis of FM by blocking IL-1 family members.']},\n",

The nerve-evoked contractile responses of VD significantly impaired and, noradrenaline- and ATP-induced contractile responses of VD significantly increased in stressed rats. UCMS exposure also markedly enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation in VD tissues. Treatment with RS or QE significantly ameliorated all the aforementioned parameters.

       "  'abstract': ['Sleep is an important contributor to mental and physical health. Insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disturbances are closely linked to depression, anxiety, weight gain, diabetes, and progression of cardiometabolic disease. The high comorbidity between sleep problems, obesity, and mental illness suggest that common mechanisms are at work between them. This review discusses the presence of bivariate relations between sleep, obesity, and psychopathology, as well as the limited evidence suggesting interactions among all three. While the review identifies obstructive sleep apnea, food intake, and inflammation as potential linking mechanisms, the dearth of current literature limits strong conclusions. More data is needed to evaluate the potential moderating/mediating influences between sleep, obesity, and mental health.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['People living with HIV (PLWH) in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era may lose more life-years to tobacco use than to HIV. Yet, smoking rates are more than twice as high among PLWH than the general population, contributing not just to mortality but to other adverse health outcomes, including neurocognitive deficits (neuroHIV). There is growing evidence that synergy with chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation that persists despite ART may be one mechanism by which tobacco smoking contributes to neuroHIV. This review will summarize the differential effects of nicotine vs tobacco smoking on inflammation in addition to the effects of tobacco smoke components on HIV disease progression. We will also discuss biomarkers of inflammation via neuroimaging as well as biomarkers of nicotine dependence (e.g., nicotine metabolite ratio). Tobacco smoking and nicotine may impact ART drug metabolism and conversely, certain ARTs may impact nicotine metabolism. Thus, we will review these bidirectional relationships and how they may contribute to neuroHIV and other adverse outcomes. We will also discuss the effects of tobacco use on the interaction between peripheral organs (lungs, heart, kidney) and subsequent CNS function in the context of HIV. Lastly, given the dramatic rise in the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, we will discuss the implications of vaping on these processes. Despite the growing recognition of the importance of addressing tobacco use among PLWH, more research is necessary at both the preclinical and clinical level to disentangle the potentially synergistic effects of tobacco use, nicotine, HIV, cognition and immune dysregulation, as well as identify optimal approaches to reduce tobacco use. Graphical Abstract Proposed model of the relationships among HIV, ART, smoking, inflammation, and neurocognition. Solid lines represent relationships supported by evidence. Dashed lines represent relationships for which there is not enough evidence to make a conclusion. (a) HIV infection produces elevated levels of inflammation even among virally suppressed individuals. (b) HIV is associated with deficits in cognition function. (c) Smoking rates are higher among PLWH, compared to the general population. (d) The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) is associated with smoking behavior. (e) HIV and tobacco use are both associated with higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression, and elevated levels of chronic stress. These factors may represent other mechanisms linking HIV and tobacco use. (f) The relationship between nicotine, tobacco smoking, and inflammation is complex, but it is well-established that smoking induces inflammation; the evidence for nicotine as anti-inflammatory is supported in some studies, but not others. (g) The relationship between tobacco use and neurocognition may differ for the effects of nicotine (acute nicotine use may have beneficial effects) vs. tobacco smoking (chronic use may impair cognition). (h) Elevated levels of inflammation may be associated with deficits in cognition. (i) PLWH may metabolize nicotine faster than those without HIV; the mechanism is not yet known and the finding needs validation in larger samples. We also hypothesize that if HIV-infection increases nicotine metabolism, then we should observe an attenuation effect once ART is initiated. (j) It is possible that the increase in NMR is due to ART effects on CYP2A6. (k) We hypothesize that faster nicotine metabolism may result in higher levels of inflammation since nicotine has anti-inflammatory properties.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Depression is among the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide, and a substantial proportion of patients do not respond adequately to standard antidepressants. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression is no longer limited to the chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters, but also involves the interplay of proinflammatory modulators in the central nervous system, as well as folate metabolism. Additional factors such as stress and metabolic disorders also may contribute. Multiple inflammatory, metabolic, and genetic markers have been identified and may provide critical information to help clinicians individualize treatments for patients to achieve optimal outcomes. Recent advancements in research have clarified underlying causes of depression and have led to possible new avenues for adjunctive treatment. Among these is L-methylfolate, a medical food that is thought to enhance synthesis of monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), suppress inflammation, and promote neural health. Clinical studies that assessed supplemental use of L-methylfolate in patients with usual care-resistant depression found that it resulted in improved outcomes. Patients with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant depression, and particularly subgroups with biomarkers of inflammation or metabolic disorders or folate metabolism-related genetic polymorphisms (or ≥2 of these factors), had the best responses. Considering this, the goals of this review are to 1) highlight recent advances in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder as it pertains to folate and associated biomarkers and 2) establish the profiles of patients with depression who could benefit most from supplemental use of L-methylfolate.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The classification of chronic visceral pain is complex, resulting from persistent inflammation, vascular (ischemic) mechanisms, cancer, obstruction or distension, traction or compression, and combined mechanisms, as well as unexplained functional mechanisms. Despite the prevalence, treatment options for chronic visceral pain are limited. Given this unmet clinical need, the development of novel analgesic agents, with defined targets derived from preclinical studies, is urgently needed. While various animal models have played an important role in our understanding of visceral pain, our knowledge is far from complete. Due to the complexity of visceral pain, this document will focus on chronic abdominal pain, which is the major complaint in patients with disorders of the gut-brain interaction, also referred to as functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Models for IBS are faced with challenges including a complex clinical phenotype, which is comorbid with other conditions including anxiety, depression, painful bladder syndrome, and chronic pelvic pain. Based upon the multifactorial nature of IBS with complicated interactions between biological, psychological, and sociological variables, no single experimental model recapitulates all the symptoms of IBS. This position paper will contextualize chronic visceral pain using the example of IBS and focus on its pathophysiology while providing a critical review of current animal models that are most relevant, robust, and reliable in which to screen promising therapeutics to alleviate visceral pain and delineate the gaps and challenges with these models. We will also highlight, prioritize, and come to a consensus on the models with the highest face/construct validity.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in many pathological states. Although, like many other immune molecules, ICAM-1 plays only a limited role in the abundant concert of the immune response, it may be more important than we realize. In the central nervous system (CNS), ICAM-1 is expressed in microglial cells and astrocytes and in endothelial cells in the white and gray matter of the human forebrain. It is of particular interest in psychiatric disorders for two reasons: It has a key function for the blood-brain barrier, which plays an important role in the biology of psychiatric disorders, and it is a marker for inflammation. Although the blood level of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) might be lower in acute unmedicated schizophrenia, it has been reported to be increased in many other psychiatric conditions, such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and dementia. In bipolar disorder, high sICAM levels were found during both the depressed and the manic states and also during the euthymic phase (the free interval), possibly indicating that sICAM is a trait marker. High sICAM-1 blood levels have also been found in depression comorbid to a somatic disease state. Interestingly, sICAM-1 levels also increase during aging. Some studies investigated sICAM-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of psychiatric disorders and ICAM-1 expression in postmortem CNS tissue of psychiatric patients and found that the overall duration and duration of the chronic phase of the psychiatric disorder seem to play a role in both. Moreover, confounders, such as antipsychotic and antidepressive medication, have to be considered. sICAM-1 levels seem to be associated with hypopermeability or hyperpermeability of the blood-brain barrier and thus to influence the communication between the CNS immune system, represented by glia cells, and the peripheral immune system. The balance between the influx and efflux of immune molecules into and out of the CNS may be one of the pinpoints in psychiatric disorders, in particular in the chronic phase, e.g., in schizophrenia. This aspect, however, needs further intense research, in particular to enable researchers to develop therapeutic principles based on an immune/inflammatory approach.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"The gut microbiota play an important role in many central nervous system diseases through the gut microbiota-brain axis. Recent studies suggest that nicotinamide riboside (NR) has neuroprotective properties. However, it is unknown whether NR can prevent or protect against alcohol-induced depression. Furthermore, it is unclear whether its therapeutic action involves changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. Here, we investigated the effects of NR in the mouse model of alcohol-induced depression. Treatment with NR improved the alcohol-induced depressive behaviour in mice. In addition, NR decreased the number of activated microglia in the hippocampus, and it reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and TGF-β) cytokines in the brain of mice with alcohol-induced depression. Furthermore, NR significantly upregulated BDNF and diminished the inhibition of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signalling pathway in the hippocampus of these mice. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that, compared with control and NR-treated mice, the gut microbiome richness and composition were significantly altered in the depressed mice. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that differential gut bacterial genera correlated with the levels of inflammation-related cytokines and BDNF in the brain. After faecal microbiota transplantation, cognitive behaviours, microglial activity, levels of cytokines and BDNF, and activation state of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signalling pathway (which is downstream of the BDNF receptor, TrkB) in recipient mice were similar to those in donor mice. Collectively, our findings show that NR dietary supplementation protects against alcohol-induced depression-like behaviours, possibly by altering the composition of the gut microbiota.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"The serine hydrolase monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the degradation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) into arachidonic acid and glycerol. Inhibition of 2-AG degradation leads to elevation of 2-AG, the most abundant endogenous agonist of the cannabinoid receptors (CBs) CB1 and CB2. Activation of these receptors has demonstrated beneficial effects on mood, appetite, pain, and inflammation. Therefore, MAGL inhibitors have the potential to produce therapeutic effects in a vast array of complex human diseases. The present report describes the pharmacologic characterization of [1-(4-fluorophenyl)indol-5-yl]-[3-[4-(thiazole-2-carbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]azetidin-1-yl]methanone (JNJ-42226314), a reversible and highly selective MAGL inhibitor. JNJ-42226314 inhibits MAGL in a competitive mode with respect to the 2-AG substrate. In rodent brain, the compound time- and dose-dependently bound to MAGL, indirectly led to CB1 occupancy by raising 2-AG levels, and raised norepinephrine levels in cortex. In vivo, the compound exhibited antinociceptive efficacy in both the rat complete Freund's adjuvant-induced radiant heat hypersensitivity and chronic constriction injury-induced cold hypersensitivity models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, respectively. Though 30 mg/kg induced hippocampal synaptic depression, altered sleep onset, and decreased electroencephalogram gamma power, 3 mg/kg still provided approximately 80% enzyme occupancy, significantly increased 2-AG and norepinephrine levels, and produced neuropathic antinociception without synaptic depression or decreased gamma power. Thus, it is anticipated that the profile exhibited by this compound will allow for precise modulation of 2-AG levels in vivo, supporting potential therapeutic application in several central nervous system disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Potentiation of endocannabinoid signaling activity via inhibition of the serine hydrolase monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is an appealing strategy in the development of treatments for several disorders, including ones related to mood, pain, and inflammation. [1-(4-Fluorophenyl)indol-5-yl]-[3-[4-(thiazole-2-carbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]azetidin-1-yl]methanone is presented in this report to be a novel, potent, selective, and reversible noncovalent MAGL inhibitor that demonstrates dose-dependent enhancement of the major endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol as well as efficacy in models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Immunomodulation is increasingly being recognised as a part of mental diseases. Here, we examined whether levels of immunological protein markers changed with depression, age, or the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). An analysis of plasma samples from patients with a major depressive episode and control blood donors (CBD) revealed the expression of 67 inflammatory markers. Thirteen of these markers displayed augmented levels in patients compared to CBD. Twenty-one markers correlated with the age of the patients, whereas 10 markers correlated with the age of CBD. Interestingly, CST5 and CDCP1 showed the strongest correlation with age in the patients and CBD, respectively. IL-18 was the only marker that correlated with the MADRS-S scores of the patients. Neuronal growth factors (NGFs) were significantly enhanced in plasma from the patients, as was the average plasma GABA concentration. GABA modulated the release of seven cytokines in anti-CD3-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the patients. The study reveals significant changes in the plasma composition of small molecules during depression and identifies potential peripheral biomarkers of the disease.']},\n",

Compared with casein, RP reduced hepatic accumulations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitro oxide (NO), and plasma activities of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in growing and adult rats. Intake of RP led to increased mRNA levels, and protein expressions of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), nuclear factor-κB 1 (NF-αB1), reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RelA), tumor necrotic factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were decreased, whereas hepatic expressions of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were increased by RP. The activation of NF-κB was suppressed by RP through upregulation of inhibitory κB α (IκBα), resulting in decreased translocation of nuclear factor-κB 1 (p50) and RelA (p65) to the nucleus in RP groups. The present study demonstrates that RP exerts an anti-inflammatory effect to inhibit ROS-derived inflammation through suppression of the NF-κB pathway in growing and adult rats. Results suggest that the anti-inflammatory capacity of RP is independent of age.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Depression is increasingly threatening human health as a serious psychological problem. However, it is remarkable that the precise mechanism underlying depression remains unelucidated. Recent studies have clarified that non-coding RNA, including but not limited to microRNA, long non-coding RNA, and circular RNA, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. The research results cited in this paper reveal the origin, expression, distribution, function, and mechanism of microRNA in the nervous system. MicroRNA is involved in regulation of life activities, including growth, immune reaction, haematopoiesis, and metabolism, which are significant for maintaining normal physiological functions. Moreover, microRNA plays an important role in cell death and proliferation, development of cancer, and disease prognosis. Here, we also introduce the general research status of long non-coding RNA and circular RNA. Next, descriptive study methods, including fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction, northern blot, microarray technology, RNA-seq, and fluorescent in situ hybridization are discussed. Functional study methods are also summarized and divided into gain- and loss-of-function studies. Moreover, the roles of non-coding RNA in the pathogenesis of depression, including neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, HPA axis regulation, neurotransmission, neuropeptide expression, neuro-inflammation, and polyamine synthesis are discussed. Nevertheless, many unknown associations between non-coding RNA and depression remain to be clarified.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The role of noise as an environmental pollutant and its adverse effects on health are being increasingly recognized. Beyond its direct effects on the auditory system (e.g., hearing loss and tinnitus induced by exposure to high levels of noise), chronic low-level noise exposure causes mental stress associated with known cardiovascular complications. According to recent estimates of the World Health Organization, exposure to traffic noise is responsible for a loss of more than 1.5 million healthy life years per year in Western Europe alone, a major part being related to annoyance, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbance. Underlying mechanisms of noise-induced mental stress are centered on increased stress hormone levels, blood pressure, and heart rate, which in turn favor the development of cerebrocardiovascular disease such as stroke, arterial hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction. Furthermore, traffic noise exposure is also associated with mental health symptoms and psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety, which further increase maladaptive coping mechanisms (e.g., alcohol and tobacco use). From a molecular point of view, experimental studies suggest that traffic noise exposure can increase stress hormone levels, thereby triggering inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways by activation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, uncoupling of endothelial/neuronal nitric oxide synthase inducing endothelial and neuronal dysfunction. This review elucidates the mechanisms underlying the relationship between noise exposure and cerebrocardiovascular and psychological disorders, focusing on mental stress signaling pathways including activation of the autonomous nervous system and endocrine signaling and its association with inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction.']},\n",

Questionnaires measured symptomatic fatigue and depression. A blood draw was used to measure calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, N-terminal telopeptide, osteopontin, and cytokine markers of inflammation. Physical activity was measured with accelerometry. Salivary cortisol and cardiac heart rate variability also were obtained. All outcome variables were compared between groups with independent samples t-tests. Variables that were different between groups and significantly correlated (Pearson product-moment) with femoral neck BMD, were included in a theoretical model to explain femoral neck BMD.

The positive correlation between the increased levels of inflammatory cytokines observed in patients with other diseases and the byproduct of the depressive symptoms may be caused by chronic stress. Increased neuroinflammatory responses are capable of activating microglia and astrocytes, which leads to release pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 are causally related to various aspects of depression such as the behavioral symptomatology. Eventually, these elevated cytokines aggravate and propagate neuroinflammation, impairing brain functions. Thus, activated astrocytes and microglia may be potential mediators in neuroinflammatory processes contributing to the development of depression.']},\n",

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis abnormalities have been linked to both childhood trauma and depression, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the link between childhood trauma, HPA axis activity and antidepressant response in patients with depression. As part of the Wellcome Trust NIMA consortium, 163 depressed patients and 55 healthy volunteers were included in this study. Adult patients meeting Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Version-5 criteria for major depression were categorised into subgroups of treatment responder (n\\xa0=\\xa042), treatment non-responder (n\\xa0=\\xa080) and untreated depressed (n\\xa0=\\xa041) based on current depressive symptom severity measured by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and exposure to antidepressant medications established by Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was obtained. Baseline serum C-reactive protein was measured using turbidimetric detection. Salivary cortisol was analyzed at multiple time points during the day using the ELISA technique. Glucocorticoid resistance was defined as the coexistence of hypercortisolemia and inflammation. Our results show that treatment non-responder patients had higher exposure to childhood trauma than responders. No specific HPA axis abnormalities were found in treatment non-responder depressed patients. Untreated depressed showed increased diurnal cortisol levels compared with patients on antidepressant medication, and higher prevalence of glucocorticoid resistance than medicated patients and controls. The severity of childhood trauma was associated with increased diurnal cortisol levels only in individuals with glucocorticoid resistance. Therefore, our findings suggest that the severity of childhood trauma experience contributes to a lack of response to antidepressant treatment. The effects of childhood trauma on increased cortisol levels are specifically evident in patients with glucocorticoid resistance and suggest glucocorticoid resistance as a target for the development of personalized treatment for a subgroup of depressed patients with a history of childhood trauma rather than for all patients with resistance to antidepressant treatment.']},\n",

IL-17A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that initiates the production of other cytokines, thereby inducing and mediating immune response. It is also involved in allergic and autoimmune-related diseases.

Dysbiosis, or alteration in the normal intestinal flora, modulates intestinal permeability, inflammation, gut motility and likely quality of life. These biomechanical changes are associated with enteric and central nervous system processing as well. When compared to healthy controls, IBS patients display poor quality of life measures and are at increased risk of depression and anxiety. The severity of psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS has been linked with a distinct intestinal microbiota signature. Efforts to modulate intestinal dysbiosis in IBS have shown little improvement in large systematic reviews. The low FODMAP diet reduces bacteria, such as Bifidobacterum and Actinobacteria. Although rifaximin improves symptoms, it may only stimulate a transient effect on the gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplant does not provide prolonged symptom relief in IBS.',\n",

Thus, it is believed that other systems or pathways which regulate brain networks involved in mood regulation and cognition are associated with MDD pathogenesis. Studies in humans and animal models have been shown that in MDD there are increased levels of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines in both periphery and central nervous system (CNS). In addition, microglial activation appears to be a key event that triggers changes in signaling cascades and gene expression that would be determinant for the onset of depressive symptoms. Recent researches also point out that changes in the gut microbiota would lead to a systemic inflammation that in different ways would reach the CNS modulating inflammatory pathways and especially the microglia, which could influence responses to treatments. Moreover, pre- and probiotics have shown antidepressant responses and anti-inflammatory effects.

       "  'abstract': [\"Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in patients with cardiac diseases. Co morbid Depression in cardiac patients causes a significant reduction in health related quality of life for the patients and inflicts an economic burden on society. Two types of mechanisms that may explain the link between depression and cardiac diseases are the psychosocial and physiopathological mechanisms. Physiopathological mechanisms are direct biological mechanisms which include hyperactivity of non-adrenergic and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA), abnormal platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammatory process. Psychosocial factors include behavioral or lifestyle factors like smoking alcoholism and physical inactivity. Pharmacologic and therapeutic interventions are effective at reducing symptoms of depression in patients with cardiac disorders. Among pharmacological treatment, SSRIs seems to be effective for the reduction of depressive symptoms among patients with cardiac disorders because of their good efficacy and minimal cardiovascular side effects. Mechanisms of action of SSRI's in depressive patients with cardiac disorders are associated with their ability to reduce inflammation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction. This review focuses on the potential pysiopathological and psychosocial links between cardiac diseases and depression, the treatment options, and importance of routine screening of depressive symptoms in cardiac settings.\"]},\n",

Recent studies have suggested T-type calcium channels as an attractive target for the treatment of chronic pain. In this perspective, it was decided to perform a preclinical evaluation of the efficacy of ethosuximide, a T-type channel blocker used clinically as an antiepileptic, as a novel pharmacological treatment for chronic pain. Assessment of the effect of ethosuximide was thus made in both nociception and pain-related comorbidities as anxiety and depression are frequently encountered in chronic pain patients. Our results show that such symptoms occurred in three animal models of chronic pain designed to reflect traumatic neuropathic, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic and inflammatory pain conditions. Administration of ethosuximide reduced both chronic pain and comorbidities with a marked intensity ranging from partial reduction to a complete suppression of symptoms. These results make ethosuximide, and more broadly the inhibition of T-type calcium channels, a new strategy for the management of uncontrolled chronic pain, likely to improve not only pain but also the accompanying anxiety and depression.']},\n",

Our study aimed to explore the anti-depression effect of SA and screen the target proteins regulated by SA in a rat model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression. Results showed that 8-week CUMS combined with separation could successfully produce depressive-like behaviours and cause a decrease of dopamine (DA) in rat hippocampus, and 4-week administration of SA could relieve CUMS rats' depressive symptoms and up-regulated DA content. There were 15 kinds of significant differentially expressed proteins that were detected not only between the control and CUMS groups, but also between the CUMS and SA treatment groups. Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) was down-regulated by CUMS while up-regulated by SA. These findings reveal that SA may exert antidepressant effects by up-regulating the expression level of PRRT2 and increasing DA content in hippocampus. The identification of these 15 differentially expressed proteins, including PRRT2, provides further insight into the treatment mechanism of SA for depression.\"]},\n",

Minocycline, a neuroprotective drug has minimized depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorders and anxiety-like symptoms. In addition, minocycline demonstrated efficacy and seemed a promising neuroprotective agent in acute stroke patients. The present studied evaluated the effects of minocycline treatment on the depression and anxiety-like behaviors, brain damage and expression of inflammatory and neuroprotective mediators after transient global cerebral ischemia in C57BL/6 mice. Brain ischemia was induced by bilateral occlusion of the common carotids (BCCAo) for 25 min and subsequent reperfusion. Sham and BCCAo animals received minocycline at a dose of 30 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection during 14 days. The locomotor activity, depression and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed by open field, forced swim and elevated plus maze tests, respectively. Then, the brains were removed and processed to evaluate brain damage by histological and morphometric analysis, hippocampal neurodegeneration using Fluoro-Jade C histochemistry, microglial activity using iba-1 immunohistochemistry, brain levels of TNF, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70 and CCL2 by CBA, CX3CL1 and BDNF by ELISA assays. The animals developed depression and anxiety-like behaviors post-stroke and minocycline treatment prevented those neurobehavioral changes. Moreover, minocycline-treated BCCAo animals showed less intense brain damage in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and cerebellum as well as significantly reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration. BCCAo groups exhibited up-regulation of some cytokines at day 14 after ischemia and brain levels of CX3CL1 and BDNF remained unaltered. Our data indicate that the depression and anxiety-like behavioral improvements promoted by minocycline treatment might be related to its neuroprotective effect after brain ischemia in mice.']},\n",

Observational studies support associations between dietary fiber intake and depression and inflammation, but the potential mechanisms are poorly understood. This review examines evidence of the effects of dietary fiber on depression and inflammation and considers plausible mechanisms linking dietary fiber and depression, including microbiota-driven modification of gene expression and increased production of neurotransmitters. Additionally, inflammation may mediate the relationship between dietary fiber intake and depression. A high-fiber diet potentially lowers inflammation by modifying both the pH and the permeability of the gut. The resultant reduction in inflammatory compounds may alter neurotransmitter concentrations to reduce symptoms of depression. Further research into the link between dietary fiber intake and inflammation and depression is essential, as findings could potentially provide guidance for improvement in or prevention of inflammatory and depressive disorders.']},\n",

To effectively treat these diverse risk factors, a broad acting strategy is required and is has been suggested that gut-brain-axis signaling may play a pinnacle role in promoting resilience to several of these stress-induced changes including pathogenic load, inflammation, HPA-axis activation, oxidative stress and neurotransmitter imbalances. The gut microbiota also manages the bioaccessibility of phenolic metabolites from dietary polyphenols whose multiple beneficial properties have known therapeutic efficacy against depression. Although several potential therapeutic mechanisms of dietary polyphenols toward establishing cognitive resilience to neuropsychiatric disorders have been established, only a handful of studies have systematically identified how the interaction of the gut microbiota with dietary polyphenols can synergistically alleviate the biological signatures of depression. The current review investigates several of these potential mechanisms and how synbiotics, that combine probiotics with dietary polyphenols, may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for depression. In particular, synbiotics have the potential to alleviate neuroinflammation by modulating microglial and inflammasome activation, reduce oxidative stress and balance serotonin metabolism therefore simultaneously targeting several of the major pathological risk factors of depression. Overall, synbiotics may act as a novel therapeutic paradigm for neuropsychiatric disorders and further understanding the fundamental mechanisms of gut-brain-axis signaling will allow full utilization of the gut microbiota's as a therapeutic tool.\"]},\n",

We sought to determine whether AD could induce anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms in mice and to identify pertinent signaling changes in brain reward circuitry. AD-like lesions were induced by the repeated intradermal application of MC903 into the cheek of the mouse. We assessed dermatitis severity with scratching behavior, histopathological changes, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors using the elevated plus maze, open field and tail suspension tests, and serum corticosterone levels. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum (DS) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), protein levels of dopamine- and plasticity-related signaling molecules were determined by Western immunoblotting assay. Intradermal administration of MC903 into mouse cheek provoked a strong hind limb scratching behavior as well as the robust skin inflammation with epidermal thickening. MC903-treated mice also displayed markedly increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, along with elevated serum corticosterone levels. Under these conditions, enhanced cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, 32\\xa0kDa (DARPP32) phosphorylation, significantly higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ΔFosB, but reduced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) protein expression were found in the NAc, DS and VTA. Striatal BDNF, phospho-DARPP32 and phospho-CREB levels were significantly associated with the levels of depressive-like behavior in these mice. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that AD-like skin lesion elicits anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes that are associated with neuroplasticity-related changes in reward circuitry, providing a better understanding of AD-associated emotional impairments.']},\n",

Cutaneous and systemic abnormalities in innate and acquired immunity play a role in its pathogenesis. The exact pathogenetic mechanism remains elusive. Evidence is accumulating that TNF-alpha, IL-17 and IL-23 signalling are highly relevant as targeting these pathways reduces disease activity. Evidence suggests a strong link between psoriasis and depression in adults. The International Psoriasis Council (IPC) held a roundtable event, \"Psoriasis and Mental Health\", in Barcelona, Spain which focused on the presence of depression and suicidality, plus the role of neuroinflammation in psoriasis, sleep disruption and the impact of depression on cardiovascular disease outcomes. We summarize here the expert presentations to provide additional insight into the understanding of psychiatric comorbidities of psoriasis and of the impact of chronic, systemic inflammation on neuro- and cardiovascular outcomes. the associations between psoriasis and other psychiatric comorbidities are still controversial and warrant further attention.']},\n",

Most previous studies did not adjust for important confounders, evaluated only individual measures of microvascular dysfunction, and showed inconsistent results. We evaluated the association between a comprehensive set of measures of microvascular dysfunction and cognitive performance in the population-based Maastricht Study. We used cross-sectional data including 3011 participants (age 59.5±8.2; 48.9% women; 26.5% type 2 diabetes mellitus [oversampled by design]). Measures of microvascular dysfunction included magnetic resonance imaging features of cerebral small vessel disease, plasma biomarkers of microvascular dysfunction, albuminuria, flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation response and heat-induced skin hyperemia. These measures were summarized into a microvascular dysfunction composite score. Cognitive domains assessed were memory, processing speed, and executive function. A cognitive function score was calculated as the sum of the scores on these 3 cognitive domains. The microvascular dysfunction score was associated with a worse cognitive function score (standardized β, -0.087 [95% CI, -0.127 to -0.047]), independent of age, education level, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, total/HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, lipid-modifying medication, prior cardiovascular disease, depression and plasma biomarkers of low-grade inflammation. The fully adjusted β-coefficient of the association between the microvascular dysfunction score and the cognitive function score was equivalent to 2 (range, 1-3) years of aging for each SD higher microvascular dysfunction score. The microvascular dysfunction score was associated with worse memory and processing speed but not with worse executive function. The present study shows that microvascular dysfunction is associated with worse cognitive performance.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia symptoms frequently occur in major depressive disorder (MDD). The pathophysiology of these symptoms may in part, be ascribed to activated immune pathways, although it is unclear whether muscular factors play a role in their onset. The aim of the present study is to examine the role of muscle proteins in major depression in association with symptoms of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. We measured serum levels of agrin, talin-2, titin, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) as well as the FibroFatigue (FF), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores in 60 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. The results show a significant increase in agrin and talin-2 in MDD patients as compared with controls. There were highly significant correlations between agrin and HAM-D, BDI-II and FF scores. Agrin, but not talin or titin, was significantly and positively associated with all 12 items of the FF scale. We found that a large part of the variance in HAM-D (47.4%), BDI-II (43.4%) and FF (43.5%) scores was explained by the regression on agrin, smoking, female sex (positively associated) and education (inversely associated). CPK was significantly and inversely associated with the total FF score and with muscle and gastro-intestinal symptoms, fatigue, a flu-like malaise, headache and memory, autonomic and sleep disturbances. These results suggest that aberrations in neuromuscular (NMJs) and myotendinous junctions play a role in MDD and that the aberrations in NMJs coupled with lowered CPK may play a role in chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia symptoms in MDD. Moreover, the increase of agrin in MDD probably functions as part of the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS).']},\n",

We measured PAI-1 in the plasma of healthy and depressed individuals and assessed plasminogen activator (PA) expression and regulation by PAI-1 in cultured normal human astrocytes (NHA). Elevated plasma PAI-1 levels were found in depressed patients. Brain tissues from depressed individuals also showed stronger expression of hippocampal PAI-1 by confocal imaging in comparison to healthy individuals. Using a lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory model of depression in mice, we measured PAI-1 in murine plasma and brain, by ELISA and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Similar elevations were seen in plasma but not in brain homogenates of mice exposed to LPS. We further correlated the findings with depressive behavior. Ex vivo experiments with NHA treated with proinflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of depression showed increased PAI-1 expression. Furthermore, these studies suggest that urokinase-type plasminogen activator may serve as an astrocyte PA reservoir, able to promote cleavage of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during stress or inflammation. In summary, our findings confirm that derangements of PAI-1 variably occur in the brain in association with the depressive phenotype. These derangements may impede the availability of active, mature (m)BDNF and thereby promote a depressive phenotype.']},\n",

The autonomic nervous system, particularly the central neural networks that control breathing and peripheral and central chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors that modulate the activity of the central respiratory network, are rapidly developing during the last trimester (22-37 weeks gestation) of fetal life. With advances in neonatology, in well-resourced, developed countries, infants born as young as 23 weeks gestation can survive. Thus, a substantial part of maturation of central and peripheral systems that control breathing occurs ex-utero in infants born at the limit of viability. The balance of excitatory and inhibitory influences dictates the ultimate output from the central respiratory network. We propose in this review that simply being born early in the last trimester can trigger homeostatic plasticity within the respiratory network tipping the balance toward inhibition that persists in infancy. We discuss the intersection of premature birth, homeostatic plasticity and biological mechanisms leading to respiratory depression during inflammation in former premature infants.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The global prevalence of migraine as a primary headache has been estimated as 14.4% in both sexes. Migraine headache has been ranked as the highest contributor to disability in under 50\\u2009years old population in the world. Extensive research has been conducted in order to clarify the pathological mechanisms of migraine. Although uncertainties remains, it has been indicated that vascular dysfunction, cortical spreading depression (CSD), activation of the trigeminovascular pathway, pro-inflammatory and oxidative state may play a putative role in migraine pain generation. Knowledge about pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine should be integrated into a multimodal treatment approach to increase quality of life in patients. With respect to this, within the integrative health studies growing interest pertains to dietary interventions. Although the number of studies concerning effects of diet on headache/migraine is not yet very large, the current article will review the available evidence in this area. All publications on headache/migraine and dietary interventions up to May 2019 were included in the present review through a PubMed/MEDLINE and ScienceDirect database search. According to the current findings, Ketogenic diet and modified Atkins diet are thought to play a role in neuroprotection, improving mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, compensating serotoninergic dysfunction, decreasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) level and suppressing neuro-inflammation. It can also be speculated that prescription of low glycemic diet may be promising in headache/migraine control through attenuating the inflammatory state. Moreover, obesity and headaches including migraine could be attributed to each other through mechanisms like inflammation, and irregular hypothalamic function. Thereby, applying dietary strategies for weight loss may also ameliorate headache/migraine. Another important dietary intervention that might be effective in headache/migraine improvement is related to balance between the intake of essential fatty acids, omega-6 and omega-3 which also affect inflammatory responses, platelet function and regulation of vascular tone. Regarding elimination diets, it appears that targeted these diets in migraine patients with food sensitivities could be effective in headache/migraine prevention. Taken together, dietary approaches that could be considered as effective strategies in headache/migraine prophylaxis include weight loss diets in obese headache patients, ketogenic and low-calorie diets, reducing omega-6 and increasing omega-3 fatty acid intakes.']},\n",

Possible mechanisms include cerebral vasodilation-associated stretching of the vessel nociceptors, sensitization of perivascular nociceptors mediated by nitric oxide, cerebral calcitonin gene-related peptide, activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway, cortical spreading depression, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and neurogenic inflammation. We review the clinical features, pathophysiology, and management of methemoglobinemia. We conducted a literature review of reports of symptomatic methemoglobinemia with headache. In addition, we describe a case report of a patient who presented with an acute onset of severe holocranial headache associated with rapidly progressive perioral paresthesia, cyanosis in lips and hands, nausea, and mild dyspnea on exertion. These features can be misinterpreted as an acute attack of migraine with pain-related hyperventilation syndrome and anxiety leading to clinically detrimental delay in the management of the progressive hypoxia. Her symptoms resolved following treatment with methylene blue. The complex relationship of migraine and hypoxia-related headaches is also reviewed. We propose that methemoglobinemia-associated headaches are possibly generated by stretching of the nociceptor nerve endings during cerebral vasodilation and hypoxia-mediated oxidative stress.',\n",

Bacterial functions in the gut play a critical role in healthy host functioning, and its disruption can contribute to many medical conditions. The relationship between gut microbiota and the brain has gained attention in mental health due to the mounting evidence supporting the association of gut bacteria with mood and behavior. Patients with bipolar disorder exhibit an increased frequency of gastrointestinal illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease, which mechanistically has been linked to microbial community function. While the heterogeneity in microbial communities between individuals might be associated with disease risk, it may also moderate the efficacy or adverse effects associated with the use of medication.

Nineteen SLE patients without overt neuropsychiatric manifestations (non-NPSLE), 31 NPSLE patients, and 23 healthy controls were examined. Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI was used and cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume values were estimated in six manually selected regions of interest of brain regions suspected to play a role in anxiety and depression (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampi, caudate nuclei and putamen). NPSLE patients reported high rates of anxiety and depression symptomatology. Significantly reduced cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume values were detected in the NPSLE group compared to healthy controls in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, bilaterally. Within the NPSLE group, anxiety symptomatology was significantly associated with lower perfusion in frontostriatal regions and in the right anterior cingulate gyrus. Importantly, the latter associations appeared to be specific to anxiety symptoms, as they persisted after controlling for depression symptomatology and independent of the presence of visible lesions on conventional MRI. In conclusion, hypoperfusion in specific limbic and frontostriatal regions is associated with more severe anxiety symptoms in the context of widespread haemodynamic disturbances in NPSLE.']},\n",

We used data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS), a longitudinal study of cardiovascular health among adults, collected between 2004 and 2013. We used mixed effect models to estimate the association of current-day ambient particle number concentration (PNC) on C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, and effect modification by psychosocial stressors (depression, acculturation, perceived stress, discrimination, negative life events and a composite score). Point estimates of percent difference in CRP per interquartile range change in PNC varied among women with contrasting levels of stressors: negative life events (15.7% high vs. 6.5% low), depression score (10.6% high vs. 4.6% low) and composite stress score (16.2% high vs. 7.0% low).

       "  'abstract': [\"Major psychiatric disorders are linked to early mortality and patients afflicted with these ailments demonstrate an increased risk of developing physical diseases that are characteristically seen in the elderly. Psychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia may be associated with accelerated cellular aging, indicated by shortened leukocyte\\xa0telomere\\xa0length (LTL), which could underlie this connection. Telomere shortening occurs with repeated cell division and is reflective of a cell's mitotic history. It is also influenced by cumulative exposure to inflammation and oxidative stress as well as the availability of telomerase, the\\xa0telomere-lengthening enzyme. Precariously short telomeres can cause cells to undergo senescence, apoptosis, or genomic instability; shorter LTL correlates with compromised general health and foretells mortality. Important data specify that LTL may be reduced in principal\\xa0psychiatric\\xa0illnesses, possibly in proportion to exposure to the ailment. Telomerase, as measured in peripheral blood monocytes, has been less well characterized in\\xa0psychiatric\\xa0illnesses, but a role in mood disorder has been suggested by preclinical and clinical studies. In this manuscript, the most recent studies on LTL and telomerase activity in\\xa0mood disorders are comprehensively reviewed, potential mediators are discussed, and future directions are suggested. An enhanced comprehension of cellular aging in\\xa0psychiatric\\xa0illnesses could lead to their re-conceptualizing as systemic ailments with manifestations both inside and outside the brain. At the same time, this paradigm shift could identify new treatment targets, helpful in bringing about lasting cures to innumerable sufferers across the globe.\"]},\n",

It presents the pathophysiology and interaction of sleep-related disorders and MD and summarizes clinical symptoms and therapies from a somnological perspective. BACKGROUND: A large number of patients suffering from MD report fragmented sleep with poor overall sleep quality. Sleep disorders often lead to increased symptoms such as daytime fatigue, depression, or increased pain intensity. In contrast, the perception of pain worsens the quality of sleep. Sleep is a complex regulation of hormonal and neuromodulatory influences to maintain regenerative processes and signal processing. Furthermore, interleukins (e.g., IL-6 and TNFα), messenger substances, or inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP) may have a regulatory influence on sleep. THERAPY: Sleep disorders in MD can often be treated with behavioral therapies or drug approaches. Another and very important influence is physical activity. In combination with training, regular physical activity can lead, for instance, to improved sleep quality, endurance performance, and reduced inflammation values. The change of lifestyle with regard to activity and nutrition is another key concept in the optimal therapy of patients with MD.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease not only induces motor impairments but also leads to the development of non-motor symptoms such as memory impairment, anxiety and depression. Dopaminergic axons directly innervate hippocampus and release dopamine in the local environment of hippocampus, and hence are directly involved in the modulation of hippocampal-dependent functions. Studies have explored the potential effect of dopamine on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, it is not well defined whether oxidative damage and inflammation could be associated with alteration in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and how it is associated with inflammatory conditions in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease-like phenotypes. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated mice exhibited significantly reduced dopaminergic neurons and dopamine content that resulted in impairment of motor functions. Interestingly, the formation of endogenous neuronal precursor cells and the number of neuroblasts in the hippocampus were significantly increased following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment. Net hippocampal neurogenesis was also reduced in the hippocampus after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment. These effects in the hippocampus were associated with increased oxidative stress markers and a massive reactive gliosis. Taken together, our results suggest that degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons directly affects the local hippocampal microenvironment by enhancing inflammatory influences. The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus may alter the endogenous regenerative capacity of the brain. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents could be a potential therapy for the improvement of the endogenous regenerative capacity of the aging or neurodegenerative brain.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Depression during pregnancy and the post-partum is common, with severe cases resulting in suicidal behavior. Despite the urgent and unmet medical need, the biological underpinnings of peri-partum depression remain unclear. It has been suggested that it is triggered by dynamic changes of the immune system during pregnancy and at delivery. Therefore, we investigated whether a pro-inflammatory status in plasma, together with changes in the kynurenine pathway activity, is associated with the development of severe depression and suicidal behavior in the post-partum. Our cross-sectional study targets a unique, understudied population in which the pronounced severity of symptoms required hospitalization. We analyzed plasma IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, tryptophan, serotonin, kynurenine, nicotinamide, quinolinic- and kynurenic acids in post-partum women diagnosed with peripartum onset depression (PPD) and healthy controls (n\\u202f=\\u202f165). We assessed depression severity using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and suicidality using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. We found that increased plasma IL-6 and IL-8 and reductions of serotonin, IL-2 and quinolinic acid were associated with the severity of depressive symptoms and increased the risk for PPD. Moreover, women with lower serotonin levels were at an increased risk for suicidal behavior, even when adjusting for depression severity, psychosocial factors, age BMI, and medication. Our results indicate that severe depression in the post-partum involves dysregulation of the immune response and the kynurenine pathway, with a concomitant reduction in serotonin levels. We propose that inflammatory cytokines and the kynurenine pathway are potential treatment targets in PPD, opening up the possibility of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the peripartum.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Global cerebral ischemia (GCI) commonly occurs in the elderly. Subcortical white matter lesions and oligodendrocyte (OLG) loss caused by cerebral ischemia have been implicated in the development of post-ischemic depression and cognitive impairment. OLGs are necessary for axonal myelination; the disrupted differentiation of OLG progenitor cells (OPCs) is associated with impaired remyelination. Evidence has indicated that increased levels of inflammatory cytokines released from activated microglia induce depression-like behaviors by affecting neurotransmitter pathways, but the mechanisms remain elusive. We explored the potential mechanisms that link microglia activation with GCI-induced depression and cognitive dysfunction by studying effects of minocycline on white matter damage, cytokine levels, and the monoaminergic neurotransmitters. An acute GCI animal model was generated through bilateral common carotid artery occlusion to induce ischemic inflammation and subcortical white matter damage. Minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia activation, was intraperitoneally administrated immediately after surgery and continued daily for additional six days. Minocycline shortened the immobile duration in tail suspension test and forced swimming test, while no improvement was found in Morris water maze test. The plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, HMGB1, and netrin-1 were significantly reduced with the treatment of minocycline. Minocycline treatment substantially reversed demyelination in corpus callosum and hippocampus, alleviated hippocampal microglia activation, and promoted OPCs maturation, while no effect was found on hippocampal neurodegeneration. Besides, the content of dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus was upregulated by minocycline treatment after GCI. Collectively, our data demonstrated that minocycline exerts an anti-depressant effect by inhibiting microglia activation, promoting OPCs maturation and remyelination. Increased DA in hippocampus may also play a role in ameliorating depressive behavior with minocycline treatment.']},\n",

Supplementation of certain microbial strains has been demonstrated to alleviate depressive behaviors and neurological abnormalities. This study took the approach to screen for an anti-depressive Bifidobacterium longum strain from fourteen candidates and systematically verified its effect in a chronic stress-induced depression mice model. B. longum subsp. infantis strain CCFM687 could significantly enhance the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HTP) in vitro in RIN14B cells through up-regulation of the Tph1 gene expression. Administration of CCFM687 in mice significantly improved the scores in behavioral tests and increased the level of 5-HTP and serotonin (5-HT) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the PFC was also increased, possibly through the 5-HT1A-CREB-BDNF pathway. In addition, CCFM687 alleviated the hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response and accordingly reversed the peripheral inflammation status. Moreover, the stress-induced structural and functional dysbiosis of the gut microbiome was improved by CCFM687, through increased alpha diversity and abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, in conjunction with inhibition of pathogenic gene expression. In summary, these results indicate that supplementation of B. longum subsp. infantis strain CCFM687 may prevent the onset of depression from chronic stress, and RIN14B could serve as an efficient cell model for rapid screening of anti-depressive probiotics.']},\n",

Translocator protein 18\\u202fkDa (TSPO) is a mitochondrial protein expressed on microglia in the CNS that has been proposed to be a useful biomarker for brain injury and inflammation. We hypothesized that a TSPO antagonist, ONO-2952, would inhibit the neuroinflammation induced by microglial hyperactivation and associated depressive-like behaviors. An in vitro analysis showed that ONO-2952 suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in cultured microglia stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. In mice submitted to chronic social defeat stress, microglia predominantly expressed TSPO in limbic areas implicated in depressive-like behaviors, including the amygdala, ventral hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, in which an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo were associated. Treating animals with ONO-2952 during chronic social defeat stress ameliorated impairments in social avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting that ONO-2952 exerted an anti-stress effect in this animal model of depression. Thus, targeting TSPO as a candidate for the development of antidepressants that reduce susceptibility to chronic stress could pave the way toward therapeutic interventions for relapse prophylaxis in depression.']},\n",

The correlation analysis indicated that the microbiota composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped microbiota composition. This study provides a clue for understanding the systemic mechanism of anti-depression effects of sesamin.']},\n",

Utilizing synchrotron X-ray diffraction we show that cardiac relaxation and cross-bridge dynamics are impaired by myosin head displacement from actin filaments particularly in the inner myocardium.

Fucoidan is a bioactive sulfated polysaccharide abundant in brown seaweeds with anti-inflammatory activity. However, the antidepressant effects of fucoidan on chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors have not been well elucidated. Here, we used two different depressive-like mouse models, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and chronic restraint stress (CRS) models, to explore the detailed molecular mechanism underlying its antidepressant-like effects in C57BL/6J mice by combining multiple behavioral, molecular and immunofluorescence experiments. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of caspase-1 and pharmacological inhibitors were also used to clarify the antidepressant mechanisms of fucoidan. We found that acute administration of fucoidan did not produce antidepressant effects in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST). Interestingly, chronic fucoidan administration not only dose-dependently reduced stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in the TST, FST, sucrose preference test (SPT), and novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT), but also alleviated the downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent synaptic plasticity via inhibiting caspase-1-mediated inflammation in the hippocampus of mice. Moreover, fucoidan significantly ameliorated behavioral and synaptic plasticity abnormalities in the overexpression of caspase-1 in the hippocampus of mice. Furthermore, blocking BDNF abolished the antidepressant-like effects of fucoidan in mice. Therefore, our findings clearly indicate that fucoidan provides a potential supplementary noninvasive treatment for depression by inhibition of hippocampal inflammation.']},\n",

Subjects with CTE can have a wide range of emotional, cognitive and physical symptoms. The cognitive group patients had a significantly higher probability of developing dementia in later years. Currently, there are no disease modifying regimen for CTE. Timely intervention of head blow could diminish the development of CTE. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is a common adjunct used to promote bone healing for fresh fracture. Recent reports suggest that LIPUS can noninvasively modulate the cortical function and have neuroprotective effect in various animal models of traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. The multifunctional mechanisms of LIPUS neuroprotective effect include several trophic factor stimulations, anti-inflammatory properties and reduction of brain edema. From the above evidence, LIPUS intervention could be a strategy for the prevention of the clinical CTE sequelae of repetitive head blows. We hypothesized that due to its neuroprotective effects, the non-invasive and easy-to-use method of LIPUS brain stimulation could have a preventive effect on players who have head blows during the match. The development of a time sensitive protocol, resembling the therapeutic algorithm for traumatic brain injury, would potentially prevent the development of subsequent CTE adverse outcome. Further long-term longitudinal studies of LIPUS stimulation are warranted to verify the prevention efficacy of this intervention for CTE.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Depression is a common psychiatric disorder that has been poorly understood. Consequently, current antidepressant agents have clinical limitations. Until today, most have exhibited the slow onset of therapeutic action and, more importantly, their effect on remission has been minimal. Thus, the need to find new forms of therapeutic intervention is urgent. The inflammation hypothesis of depression is widely acknowledged and is one that theories the relationship between the function of the immune system and its contribution to the neurobiology of depression. In this research, we utilized an environmental isolation (EI) approach as a valid animal model of depression, employing biochemical, molecular, and behavioral studies. The aim was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor on a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR 7) signaling pathway in a depressive rat model, and compare these actions to fluoxetine, a standard antidepressant agent. The behavioral analysis indicates that depression-related symptoms are reduced after acute administration of fluoxetine and, to a lesser extent, etanercept, and are prevented by enriched environment (EE) housing conditions. Experimental studies were conducted by evaluating immobility time in the force swim test and pleasant feeling in the sucrose preference test. The mRNA expression of the TLR 7 pathway in the hippocampus showed that TLR 7, MYD88, and TRAF6 were elevated in isolated rats compared to the standard group, and that acute treatment with an antidepressant and anti-inflammatory drugs reversed these effects. This research indicates that stressful events have an impact on behavioral well-being, TLR7 gene expression, and the TLR7 pathway. We also found that peripheral administration of etanercept reduces depressive-like behaviour in isolated rats: this could be due to the indirect modulation of the TLR7 pathway and other TLRs in the brain. Furthermore, fluoxetine treatment reversed depressive-like behaviour and molecularly modulated the expression of TLR7, suggesting that fluoxetine exerts antidepressant effects partially by modulating the TLR7 signaling pathway.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Influenza has frequently been epidemic in recent years. However, the mechanisms of severe pneumonia with postinfluenza Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) secondary infection have not been fully understood. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of pneumonia in postinfluenza A virus (IAV) infection via a mouse model. Mice were intranasally inoculated with SP three days after IAV inoculation. We then collected samples at three time points to dynamically observe the pathological progression. In IAV infection alone, lymphocyte infiltration and widened alveolar intervals were observed. In the blood, levels of the CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations were reduced, and IFN-γ and IL-10 were elevated. Slight atrophy was seen in the spleen, which was due to splenic B lymphocyteinitiated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. When SP infection occurred after IAV infection, the pulmonary inflammation was significantly aggravated; a fair number of lymphocytes and neutrophils infiltrated simultaneously with exfoliated bronchial epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, widened alveolar septum and hemorrhaging. Increasing edema fluid and bacteria accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Decreased CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations and increased interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin 10 (IL-10) were more prominent compared to those with viral infection alone. Spleen atrophy resulting from coinfection was more obvious because of massive splenic B lymphocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway compared to viral infection alone. This study shows that although inflammation caused by SP infection alone was temporary, preceding IAV infection provided favorable conditions for SP colonization and multiplication by destroying lung structure and suppressing humoral immunity. Synergistic IAV-SP coinfection is likely to facilitate more SP colonization and promote B lymphocyte-suppression and reduction. Eventually, the pneumonia worsened.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Added sugars are ubiquitous in contemporary Western diets. Although excessive sugar consumption is now robustly associated with an array of adverse health consequences, comparatively little research has thus far addressed its impact on the risk of mental illness. But ample evidence suggests that high-dose sugar intake can perturb numerous metabolic, inflammatory, and neurobiological processes. Many such effects are of particular relevance to the onset and maintenance of depressive illness, among them: systemic inflammation, gut microbiota disruption, perturbed dopaminergic reward signaling, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and the generation of toxic advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Accordingly, we hypothesize that added dietary sugars carry the potential to increase vulnerability to major depressive disorder, particularly at high levels of consumption. The present paper: (a) summarizes the existing experimental and epidemiological research regarding sugar consumption and depression vulnerability; (b) examines the impact of sugar ingestion on known depressogenic physiological processes; and (c) outlines the clinical and theoretical implications of the apparent sugar-depression link. We conclude that the extant literature supports the hypothesized depressogenic impact of added dietary sugars, and propose that an improved understanding of the effects of sugar on body and mind may aid in the development of novel therapeutic and preventative measures for depression.']},\n",

Empirical research has linked inflammatory markers to depressive symptoms and acute psychosocial stress; however, a gap remains as to whether immune response to stress may serve as a putative mechanism of treatment. This preliminary pilot study determined the modest feasibility of assessing psychobiological response to stress as a predictor of CBT outcomes for youth with mood disorders. We evaluated whether participation in a 10-session group-CBT intervention for mood disorders altered inflammatory response to a laboratory psychosocial stress induction and if this alteration in immune stress responsivity was related to a decrease in depressive symptoms. Thirty-four youth (age M = 15.03, SD = 1.91) diagnosed with BD or MDD participated in a 10-session CBT group and pre- and post-group assessments; twenty-eight participants who completed the group had usable cytokine data. Pre- and post-group assessments included stress induction with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) during which inflammatory cytokines were measured at baseline (time 0) and after the TSST at 30, 60, and 90\\u202fmin. Results suggest it is modestly feasible to measure immune response to stress alongside CBT treatment for adolescent mood disorders. Our findings were mixed; across seven cytokines, hierarchical linear models indicated two cytokines, IL6 and IL12, were sensitive to acute laboratory stress. We also found significant correlations between life stress, inflammation, and depression both pre- and post- CBT group. Inflammation pre-group, as measured by IL12 and IL1 β predicted depressive symptoms following treatment. Although we did not find significant within-subject reductions in inflammation, chronic stress predicted changes in IL β, signaling the central role of chronic stress. This study offers preliminary evidence that immune responsivity to stress induction could serve as a mechanism of treatment for mood disorders in youth, indicating a potential marker for more personalized model of healthcare.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Errors in neuron-microglial interaction are known to lead to microglial phagocytosis of live neurons and excessive neuronal loss, potentially yielding poorer clinical outcomes. Factors that affect neuron-microglial interaction have the potential to influence the error rate. Clinical comorbidities that unfavorably impact neuron-microglial interaction may promote a higher rate of neuronal loss, to the detriment of patient outcome. This paper proposes that many common, clinically modifiable comorbidities have a common thread, in that they all influence neuron-microglial interactions. Comorbidities like traumatic brain injury, infection, stress, neuroinflammation, loss of neuronal metabolic integrity, poor growth factor status, and other factors, all have the potential to alter communication between neurons and microglia. When this occurs, microglial phagocytosis of live neurons can increase. In addition, microglia can shift into a morphological form in which they express major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II), allowing them to function as antigen presenting cells that present neuronal debris as antigen to invading T cells. This can increase risk for the development of CNS autoimmunity, or can exacerbate existing CNS autoimmunity. The detrimental influence of these comorbidities has the potential to contribute to the mosaic of factors that determine patient outcome in some CNS pathologies that have neuropsychiatric involvement, including TBI and CNS disorders with autoimmune components, where excessive neuronal loss can yield poorer clinical outcomes. Recognition of the impact of these comorbidities may contribute to an understanding of the common clinical observation that many seemingly disparate factors contribute to the overall picture of case management and clinical outcome in these complex disorders. In a clinical setting, knowing how these comorbidities can influence neuron-microglial interaction can help focus surveillance and care on a broader group of potential therapeutic targets. Accordingly, an interest in the mechanisms underlying the influence of these factors on neuron-microglial interactions is appropriate. Neuron-microglial interaction is reviewed, and the various mechanisms by which these potential comorbidities influence neuro-microglial interaction are described.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Suicide is a major health problem in the modern world. However, its physiological mechanisms have not been well elucidated yet. Immunological disturbances have been reported in psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP), and schizophrenia. Some studies have also suggested an association between immunological alterations especially neuroinflammation, and suicide. Chemokines play important roles in inflammation, and studies investigating chemokines in psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, MDD, and BP have reported chemokine dysregulations. However, there have been very few studies on the association between chemokines and suicide. We studied chemokine alterations in the postmortem brains of suicide completers and compared them to those of controls. We obtained brain tissue samples of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 16 suicide completers and 23 controls. We examined the concentrations of chemokines and related substances in the brain tissue from these two groups using the Bio-Plex Pro™ Human Chemokine Panel 40-Plex. We performed multiple regression analysis with covariates. The levels of CCL1, CCL8, CCL13, CCL15, CCL17, CCL19, CCL20, CXCL11, and IL-10 were significantly decreased, whereas the IL-16 levels were significantly increased in the suicide completers after adjustment with the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control for type Ⅰ errors (Q\\u202f<\\u202f0.05). The observed chemokine alterations might suggest the presence of suicide-specific immunological mechanisms.']},\n",

However, the effects of CTRP3 on depression are largely unknown. In the present study, we found that CTRP3 expression levels were markedly reduced in hippocampus of mice with depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). In mouse model with depression, CTRP3-deficient mice aggravated depression-associated behaviors, as evidenced by the reduced locomotor activity and sucrose consumption, while the elevated immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). Moreover, CUMS-induced neuron death and increased expression of cleaved Caspase-3 were significantly accelerated by CTRP3 knockout. Furthermore, CTRP3 deletion intensified pro-inflammatory response in CUMS-exposed mice, which was associated with the activation of nuclear factor-κB(NF-κB) signaling. The activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 and JNK, was further promoted in hippocampus of CTRP3-knockout mice with CUMS exposure. In contrast,CTRP3 over-expression showed anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated microglial cells. Importantly, the in vitro experiments demonstrated that CTRP3 knockdown-exacerbated apoptosis and inflammatory responsewere remarkably abrogated by the blockage of p38 and JNK signaling pathways in microglia stimulated by LPS. Next, in CUMS-exposed mice with CTRP3 deficiency, suppressing p38 and JNK markedly alleviated depressive-like behavior,hippocampal neuron death, apoptosis and inflammation. Therefore, CTRP3 may be an innovative therapeutic target for treating patients with depression through regulating p38 and JNK signaling.']},\n",

Its main pathological feature is the substantial nigra-striatum dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction, which causes insufficient release of DA, induces motor symptoms, and is accompanied by nonmotor symptoms. Schisandrol A belongs to lignan components and has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. In this experiment, we injected 6-OHDA into medial forebrain bundle of C57BL/6J male mice to establish the model. The motor function of mice was examined by open field test and pole test, the depression-like behavior of mice was examined by sucrose preference test and the memory function was examined by Y maze. We found that schisandrol A (20\\u202fmg/kg/d) could significantly improve the motor symptoms, and alleviate the depression-like symptoms and memory dysfunction of PD mice induced by 6-OHDA. Then we studied the neuroprotective mechanism of schisandrol A by H.E., ELISA assay kits and Western blot. Results showed that schisandrol A may enhance the PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibit the IKK/IκBα/NF-κB pathway, reduce neuronal inflammation and oxidative stress, and enhance the survival of DA neurons in the brain of mice. These results indicate that schisandrol A is expected to be a potential drug for improving Parkinson's disease.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Chronic inflammatory processes within the central nervous system (CNS) are in part responsible for the development of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. These processes are associated with, among other things, the increased and disturbed activation of microglia and the elevated production of proinflammatory factors. Recent studies indicated that the disruption of the process of resolution of inflammation (RoI) may be the cause of CNS disorders. It is shown that the RoI is regulated by endogenous molecules called specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which interact with specific membrane receptors. Some SPMs activate formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), which belong to the family of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors take part not only in the proinflammatory response but also in the resolution of the inflammation process. Therefore, the activation of FPRs might have complex consequences. This review discusses the potential role of FPRs, and in particular the role of FPR2 subtype, in the brain under physiological and pathological conditions and their involvement in processes underlying neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders as well as ischemia, the pathogenesis of which involves the dysfunction of inflammatory processes.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Meniere's disease (MD) is a chronic condition affecting the inner ear whose precise etiology is currently unknown. We propose the hypothesis that MD is a migraine-related phenomenon which may have implications for future treatment options for both diseases. The association between MD and migraine is both an epidemiological and a mechanistic one, with up to 51% of individuals with MD experiencing migraine compared to 12% in the general population. The presence of endolymphatic hydrops in those with MD may be the factor that unites the two conditions, as hydropic inner ears have an impaired ability to maintain homeostasis. Migraine headaches are theorized to cause aura and symptoms via spreading cortical depression that ultimately results in substance P release, alterations in blood flow, and neurogenic inflammation. Chronically hydropic inner ears are less able to auto-regulate against the changes induced by active migraine attacks and may ultimately manifest as MD. This same vulnerability to derangements in homeostasis may also explain the common triggering factors of both MD attacks and migraine headaches, including stress, weather, and diet. Similarly, it may explain the efficacy of common treatments for both diseases: current migraine treatments such as anti-hypertensives and anti-convulsants have shown promise in managing MD. Though the etiology of both MD and migraine is likely multifactorial, further exploration of the association between the two conditions may illuminate how to best manage them in the future. MD is likely a manifestation of cochleovestibular migraine, which occurs as a result of migraine related changes in both the cochlea and vestibule.\"]},\n",

Angiotensin II, via activation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-mediated brain oxidative stress and inflammation may contribute to these emotional abnormalities. In this study, we investigated the role of a regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5) protein, which regulates AT1R activity, in angiotensin II-induced brain oxidative stress, inflammation and anxiety-, and depression-like behavior. We hypothesized that deletion of the RGS5 protein would worsen angiotensin II-induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior, cerebral vascular oxidative stress, and brain inflammation. Adult male wild-type and RGS5-deficient mice were implanted with osmotic minipumps delivering either vehicle (saline) or angiotensin II (1 mg/kg/d) for three weeks. Subsequently, mice were tested for locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior (using the elevated plus maze), and depression-like behavior (using the tail suspension test). After behavioral testing, brain tissue was collected to assess oxidative stress and inflammatory proteins. RGS5 deletion resulted in anxiety-like but not depression-like behavior when compared to wild-type mice. Combined deletion of RGS5 and angiotensin II treatment did not further worsen anxiety-like behavior observed in RGS5-deficient mice. In contrast, depression-like behavior was worsened in RGS5-deficient mice treated with angiotensin II. Interestingly, RGS5 deficiency and angiotensin II treatment had no effect on cerebral vascular oxidative stress, or on expression of the inflammatory marker vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in the brain. RGS5 deficiency was also associated with decreased blood pressure and an enhanced pressor response to angiotensin II. These data suggest that RGS5 protects against anxiety-like behavior and against angiotensin II-induced depression-like behavior.']},\n",

Activation of the Parkin/PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) pathway has been shown to promote autophagy of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) and to protect from endotoxin-induced cardiac dysfunction. Tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) is a key member of the endosomal recycling complexes required for transport, which may affect autophagic flux. In this study, we investigated whether TSG101 regulates mitophagy and influences the outcomes of endotoxin-induced myocardial dysfunction. TSG101 transgenic and knockdown mice underwent endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide treatment (10 μg/g) and were assessed for survival, cardiac function, systemic/local inflammation, and activity of mitophagy mediators in the heart. Upon endotoxin challenge and compared with WT mice, TSG101 transgenic mice exhibited increased survival, preserved cardiac contractile function, reduced inflammation, and enhanced mitophagy activation in the heart. By contrast, TSG101 knockdown mice displayed opposite phenotypes during endotoxemia. Mechanistically, both coimmunoprecipitation assays and coimmunofluorescence staining revealed that TSG101 directly binds to Parkin in the cytosol of myocytes and facilitates translocation of Parkin from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Our results indicate that TSG101 elevation could protect against endotoxin-triggered myocardial injury by promoting Parkin-induced mitophagy.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Small vessel disease (SVD) refers to conditions where damage to arterioles and capillaries is predominant, leading to reduced, or interrupted perfusion of the affected organ. Data suggest that when this condition is evident in any organ, it is already systemic in its occurrence and consequences. SVD affects primarily organs that receive significant portions of cardiac output such as the brain, the kidney, and the retina. Thus, SVD is a major etiologic cause in debilitating conditions such as renal failure, blindness, lacunar infarcts, and dementia. The factors that lead to this devastating condition include all the known vascular risk factors when they are not strictly controlled, but lifestyles that include sedentary existence, obesity, and poor sleep patterns are also recognized drivers of SVD. In addition, depression is now recognized as a vascular risk factor. Inflammation is a mediator of SVD, but it is not known which factor(s) predominate in its etiology. This article emphasizes the need for more investigations to define this link further and suggests clinical and societal responses that might reduce the major impacts of this condition on populations.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Chronic psychological stress is associated with an increased risk for relapse of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and impedes the treatment of this condition. However, the impact of stress on the risk of IBD onset remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) could initiate or aggravate the onset of colon inflammation in rats which, in turn, would be capable of triggering bowel disease. We found that CUMS exposure increased infiltration of CD-45 positive cells and MPO activity, as well as augmented the expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-6 within the colon of these rats. In addition, CUMS treatment changed the composition and diversity of gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal epithelial permeability, indicating the presence of a defect in the intestinal barrier. This CUMS-induced disruption of mucosal barrier integrity was associated with a reduction in expression of the tight junction protein, occludin 1, and an inhibition in mucosal layer functioning via reductions in goblet cells. Results from bacterial cultures revealed an increased presence of bacterial invasion after CUMS treatment as compared with that observed in controls. Thus, our data indicate that CUMS treatment induces alterations of the fecal microbiome and intestinal barrier defects, which facilitates bacterial invasion into colonic mucosa and further exacerbates inflammatory reactions within the colon. Accordingly, chronic stress may predispose patients to gastrointestinal infection and increase the risk of inflammation-related gut diseases.']},\n",

Their crucial biological roles dictate the significance of PPAR-targeting synthetic ligands in medical research and drug discovery. Clinical implications of PPAR agonists span across a wide range of health conditions, including metabolic diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, infections, autoimmune diseases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and malignancies. In this review we aim to consolidate existing clinical evidence of PPAR modulators, highlighting their clinical prospects and challenges. Findings from clinical trials revealed that different agonists of the same PPAR subtype could present different safety profiles and clinical outcomes in a disease-dependent manner. Pemafibrate, due to its high selectivity, is likely to replace other PPARα agonists for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. PPARγ agonist pioglitazone showed tremendous promises in many non-metabolic disorders like chronic kidney disease, depression, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The clinical niche of PPARβ/δ agonists is less well-explored. Interestingly, dual- or pan-PPAR agonists, namely chiglitazar, saroglitazar, elafibranor, and lanifibranor, are gaining momentum with their optimistic outcomes in many diseases including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and primary biliary cholangitis. Notably, the preclinical and clinical development for PPAR antagonists remains unacceptably deficient. We anticipate the future design of better PPAR modulators with minimal off-target effects, high selectivity, superior bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics. This will open new possibilities for PPAR ligands in medicine.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Modern biomedical scientists are often trapped in silos of knowledge and practice, such as those who study brain structure, function and behavior, on the one hand, and body systems and disorders, on the other. Scientists and physicians in each of those silos have not often paid attention to the brain-body communication that leads to multi-morbidity of systemic and brain-related disorders [eg. depression with diabetes or cardiovascular disease]. Outside of biomedicine, social scientists have long recognized the impact of the social and physical environment on individuals and populations but have not usually connected these effects with changes in underlying biology. However, with the rise of epigenetics, science and the public understanding of science is leaving an era in which the DNA sequence was thought to be \"destiny\" and entering an era where the environment shapes the biology and behavior of individuals and groups through its interactive effects on brain and body. It does so, at least in part, by shaping epigenetically the structure and function of brain and body systems that show a considerable amount of adaptive plasticity throughout development and adult life. This results in substantial individual differences even between identical twins. These individual differences are produced epigenetically by the two-way interaction between the brain and hormones, immune system mediators and the autonomic nervous system. Disorders, then, are often multimorbid involving both brain and body, such as depression with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is therefore imperative to incorporate into \"precision medicine\" a better understanding of how these differences affect the efficacy of pharmacological, behavioral and psychosocial interventions. This article presents an overview of this new synthesis, using as an example emerging evidence about the linkages between systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and mental health and neurodegenerative diseases.']},\n",

Blood sample and blood pressure measures were taken from 1536 participants (56.58% women; mean age at baseline\\u202f=\\u202f61.73 years, sd = 7.64). Depression symptoms were assessed every two years across a 10-year follow-up. Trajectories were identified by means of latent class mixed modelling. Inflammation and metabolic risk profile scores were obtained from plasma and diagnostic-based indicators in the follow-up, using a robust latent-factor approach. Multigroup modelling was used to study the associations between the profiles and symptom trajectories. As a result, three heterogeneous trajectories of symptoms were identified (low-symptom, moderate-symptom and high-symptom trajectory). Participants depicting a high-symptom trajectory showed the greatest inflammation profile score and high metabolic risk. Moderate-symptom trajectory was also related to high inflammation and metabolic risk. To sum up, at-risk trajectories of symptoms were associated with high inflammation and risk of metabolic diseases.

       "  'abstract': [\"In the past few decades, as a result of their anti-inflammatory properties, n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs), have gained greater importance in the regulation of inflammation, especially in the central nervous system (in this case known as neuroinflammation). If sustained, neuroinflammation is a common denominator of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and major depression, and of aging. Hence, limiting neuroinflammation is a real strategy for neuroinflammatory disease therapy and treatment. Recent data show that n-3 LC-PUFAs exert anti-inflammatory properties in part through the synthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) such as resolvins, maresins and protectins. These SPMs are crucially involved in the resolution of inflammation. They could be good candidates to resolve brain inflammation and to contribute to neuroprotective functions and could lead to novel therapeutics for brain inflammatory diseases. This review presents an overview 1) of brain n-3 LC-PUFAs as precursors of SPMs with an emphasis on the effect of n-3 PUFAs on neuroinflammation, 2) of the formation and action of SPMs in the brain and their biological roles, and the possible regulation of their synthesis by environmental factors such as inflammation and nutrition and, in particular, PUFA consumption.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 46 million people worldwide. It is characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills. AD patients also suffer from behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia of which depression is the most prevalent. Currently available drugs provide modest symptomatic relief and do not reduce pathological hallmarks (senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and neuroinflammation, both of which are integral parts of AD. Studies suggest that AD is a type of diabetes manifested in the brain. Although AD and diabetes are currently classified as separate disease entities, they share common pathophysiological mechanisms. One of them is an increased level of cytokines involved in the inflammation and the regulation of metabolic, regenerative, and neural processes. The purpose of this review was to update the most recent reports on the discovery and development of antidiabetic agents as promising drugs for the symptomatic and disease-modifying treatment of AD. We collected the results of in vitro and in vivo studies, and recent reports from clinical trials suggesting the utility of antidiabetic agents in memory-enhancing therapy of AD. Their beneficial effects on chronic neuroinflammation, pathological hallmarks, and neuropsychiatric symptoms co-occurring with cognitive deficits are also presented. Antidiabetic agents refer to the diabetic and inflammatory hypotheses of AD and provide hope to find an effective drug for comprehensive therapy of the disease.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Both neuroinflammation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) are implicated in many neurodegenerative disorders as well as in neuropsychiatric disorders, which often become symptomatic during adolescence. A better knowledge of the impact that chronic neuroinflammation has on the hippocampus during the adolescent period could lead to the discovery of new therapeutics for some of these disorders. The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to altered concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), with elevated levels implicated in the aetiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and stress-related disorders such as depression. The effect of acutely and chronically elevated concentrations of hippocampal IL-1β have been shown to reduce AHN in adult rodents. However, the effect of exposure to chronic overexpression of hippocampal IL-1β during adolescence, a time of increased vulnerability, hasn't been fully interrogated. Thus, in this study we utilized a lentiviral approach to induce chronic overexpression of IL-1β in the dorsal hippocampus of adolescent male Sprague Dawley rats for 5\\u202fweeks, during which time its impact on cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis were examined. A reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis was observed along with a reduced level of neurite branching on hippocampal neurons. However, there was no effect of IL-1β overexpression on performance in pattern separation, novel object recognition or spontaneous alternation in the Y maze. Our study has highlighted that chronic IL-1β overexpression in the hippocampus during the adolescent period exerts a negative impact on neurogenesis independent of cognitive performance, and suggests a degree of resilience of the adolescent hippocampus to inflammatory insult.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Appetite change is a defining feature of major depressive disorder (MDD), yet little neuroscientific evidence exists to explain why some individuals experience increased appetite when they become depressed while others experience decreased appetite. Previous research suggests depression-related appetite changes can be indicative of underlying neural and inflammatory differences among MDD subtypes. The present study explores the relationship between systemic inflammation and brain circuitry supporting food hedonics for individuals with MDD. Sixty-four participants (31 current, unmedicated MDD and 33 healthy controls [HC]) provided blood samples for analysis of an inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP), and completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan in which they rated the perceived pleasantness of various food stimuli. Random-effects multivariate modeling was used to explore group differences in the relationship between CRP and the coupling between brain activity and inferred food pleasantness (i.e., strength of the relationship between activity and pleasantness ratings). Results revealed that for MDD with increased appetite, higher CRP in blood related to greater coupling between orbitofrontal cortex and anterior insula activity and inferred food pleasantness. Compared to HC, all MDD exhibited a stronger positive association between CRP and coupling between activity in striatum and inferred food pleasantness. These findings suggest that for individuals with MDD, systemic low-grade inflammation is associated with differences in reward and interoceptive-related neural circuitry when making hedonic inferences about food stimuli. In sum, altered immunologic states may affect appetite and inferences about food reward in individuals with MDD and provide evidence for physiological subtypes of MDD.']},\n",

In this review, we comprehensively assess key biological and psychosocial mechanisms through which physical activity exerts antidepressant effects, with a particular focus on exercise. Exercise, a subset of physical activity, influences a range of biological and psychosocial processes also implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. We focus on the capacity for exercise to elicit changes in neuroplasticity, inflammation, oxidative stress, the endocrine system, self-esteem, social support and self-efficacy. We also discuss how a better understanding of these mechanisms can inform the way we design and implement exercise-based interventions to maximise their antidepressant effects on an individual basis. We conclude by presenting a conceptual framework of the key biological and psychosocial mechanisms underlying the relationship between physical activity and depressive symptoms, and the moderators and confounders that may influence it.']},\n",

The present study aimed to investigate the role of losartan, an AT1 receptor blocker, in the modulation of long-lasting adverse effects of repeated systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in the brain function. For this purpose, 110 male BALB/c mice were administrated LPS (250\\u202fµg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.) for seven consecutive days. Mice were i.p. injected with losartan (1 and 3\\u202fmg/kg) three days before and during the LPS injection. To determine the role of PPAR-γ activation in the protective actions of losartan, GW9662, a PPAR-γ antagonist, was also co-administrated with losartan. Then, behavioral tests, including Morris water maze (MWM), novel object recognition test, passive avoidance, forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze, and marble burying task, were conducted. The results demonstrated that losartan improved learning and memory impairment, attenuated anxiety-like behaviors, modulated brain inflammation and oxidative stress, and decreased amyloid-β accumulation. Losartan was unable to improve hippocampal BDNF and IL-10 levels as well as the retention trial in the MWM task and depressive-like behaviors. In addition, the PPAR-γ antagonist did not significantly influence the beneficial effects of losartan. Our findings suggest that AT1R blockade can protect the brain against most long-lasting hallmark effects of systemic inflammation. Also, based on the results, the beneficial actions of losartan were not mediated through PPAR-γ activation.']},\n",

Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory regulation plays an important role in pathophysiology and therapeutic mechanism across the major psychiatric disorders. \"Inflammation theory\" might not be the full answer for the big picture of mental disorders, but it might explain high occurrence of somatic symptoms and comorbidity of physical illness in certain subtypes of the heterogeneous groups. Due to the complexity of clinical manifestations and bio-psycho-social etiology, each single treatment shows only small effectiveness with limited effect sizes when compared with placebo. Unfortunately, clinicians are still struggling with trial-and-error practice without any reliable clinical or biological markers to predict therapeutic responses. Therefore, it is important to open up our minds to integrative approaches such dietary modification and nutraceutical prescription. In this special issue, we included 15 papers discussing the role of nutrition (blueberries, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, melatonergic agonist, S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine, Cannabidiol and Kratom) in the context of immunoregulation across different psychiatric disorders from depression, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia to alcohol-induced dementia and anorexia nervosa. Moreover, we also included research in perinatal depression that highlight the role of estradiol and the component of breast milk and the association with the neurodevelopment of the offspring. In addition, several articles focused on the role of microbiota in mental health and pain as recent research has pointed to the gut-brain axis as a main regulator of brain, behaviour and immunity. Lastly, inflammatory mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders including alcohol induced dementia and anorexia nervosa are also highlighted in the special issue.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Individuals with peripheral inflammation are a particularly vulnerable population for developing depression and are also more resistant towards traditional antidepressants. This signals the need for novel drugs that can effectively treat this patient population. Recently, we have demonstrated that (R,S)-ketamine is a prophylactic against a variety of stressors, but have yet to test if it is protective against inflammatory-induced vulnerability to a stressor. Here, male 129S6/SvEv mice were administered saline or (R,S)-ketamine (30\\u202fmg/kg) 6 days before an injection of vehicle (VEH) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.83 or 1.0\\u202fmg/kg, serotypes O111:B4 or O127:B8). Twenty-four hours after LPS administration, mice were administered a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm, followed by a context re-exposure and the forced swim test (FST). In a separate cohort, we tested if (R,S)-ketamine was effective as a prophylactic against polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIC), a viral mimetic. (R,S)-ketamine was effective as a prophylactic for attenuating learned fear in the O111:B4 and O127:B8 strains of LPS. (R,S)-ketamine was also effective as a prophylactic for decreasing stress-induced depressive-like behavior in the O111:B4 and O127:B8 strains of LPS. Both of these effects were limited to administration of 1.0, but not 0.83\\u202fmg/kg of the O111:B4 and O127:B8 strains of LPS. (R,S)-ketamine was not effective against either stress phenotype following PIC administration. These data suggest that prophylactic (R,S)-ketamine may protect against selective inflammation-induced stress phenotypes following an inflammatory challenge. Future studies will be necessary to determine if (R,S)-ketamine can be useful in patient populations with peripheral inflammation.']},\n",

Accumulating evidence supports an association between these disorders and inflammation. Consequently, anti-inflammatory agents, such as the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, represent a novel avenue to prevent and treat neuropsychiatric illness. In this paper, we first review the role of inflammation in psychiatric pathophysiology including inflammatory cytokines' influence on neurotransmitters, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and microglial mechanisms. We then discuss how cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitors influence these pathways with potential therapeutic benefit, with a focus on celecoxib, due to its superior safety profile. A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and PsychINFO databases, in addition to Clinicaltrials.gov and the Stanley Medical Research Institute trial registries. The results were presented as a narrative review. Currently available outcomes for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017 are also discussed. The evidence reviewed here suggests cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and in particular celecoxib, may indeed assist in treating the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders; however, further studies are required to assess appropriate illness stage-related indication.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Migraine is a common headache disorder characterized by unilateral, intense headaches. In migraine with aura, the painful headache is preceded by focal neurological symptoms that can be visual, sensory, or motor in nature. Spreading depression (the most likely cause of migraine with aura and perhaps related headache pain) results in increased neuronal excitability and related increases in inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species. This in turn can promote the transformation of low-frequency, episodic migraine into higher-frequency and eventually chronic migraine. Though migraine affects 11% of adults worldwide, with 3% experiencing chronic headache, existing therapies offer only modest benefits. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which environmental enrichment (i.e., volitionally increased intellectual, social, and physical activity) mitigates spreading depression. In prior work, we have shown that exposure to environmental enrichment reduces susceptibility to spreading depression in rats. This protective effect is at least in part due to environmental enrichment-mediated changes in the character of serum exosomes produced by circulating immune cells. We went on to show that environmental enrichment-mimetic exosomes can be produced by stimulating dendritic cells with low levels of interferon gamma (a cytokine that is phasically increased during environmental enrichment). Interferon gamma-stimulated dendritic cell exosomes (IFNγ-DC-Exos) significantly improve myelination and reduce oxidative stress when applied to hippocampal slice cultures. Here, we propose that they may also be effective against spreading depression. We found that administration of IFNγ-DC-Exos reduced susceptibility to spreading depression ']},\n",

A total of 90 patients with rectal cancer undergoing laparoscopic radical resection surgery were selected. The patients were divided into A, B and C group using a random number table method, 30 cases in each group. Patients in group A received oxycodone (O) alone postoperatively; patients in group B received dexmedetomidine combined with oxycodone (DO) postoperatively; and patients in group C received dexmedetomidine (D) alone postoperatively. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score and Ramsay sedative score at 2h, 6h, 24h and 48h after surgery were evaluated, and the effective compressions number of controlled intravenous analgesia (CIA) was recorded. The occurrence of side effects including fever, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, itchy skin, respiratory depression and other adverse reactions were noted. CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 were detected by ELISA prior to surgery and on the morning of the 1st and the 3rd day after surgery, respectively. VAS scores in group B were lower than group A and C, the effective compressions number of CIA in group B was less than group A and C, the incidence of adverse reactions in group B was lower than group A and group C. The levels of CRP, TNF-α and IL-6 at 72h after surgery in group B were lower than group A and C. Dexmedetomidine combined with oxycodone has better sedative and analgesic effects with less adverse reactions, it can reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines of CRP, TNF-α and IL-6 in the body and has certain clinical application value.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Depression, one of the most common mental health disorders, is among the leading causes of health-related disability worldwide. Although antidepressant treatment has been available for decades, depression remains largely refractory to the prevailing limited treatment approach of monoamine transmission modulation. Fortunately, recent evidence points to a link between depression and inflammatory factors within the innate and the adaptive immune system. The purpose of this review is to evaluate current and potential clinical immunotherapies for depression, as contextually focused by an immunologic lens of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of depression. The utility of pro-inflammatory cytokines (primarily interleukin-1β, interleukin -6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) is considered in their role as screening biomarkers in prediction of treatment response or nonresponse. The evidence base of numerous recent clinical studies is discussed as related to their antidepressant efficacy and favorable safety profile, with consideration of multiple agents that target inflammatory mechanisms linked to depression including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pathways (i.e., aspirin, celecoxib), cytokine antagonism (i.e., etanercept, infliximab), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor antagonism (i.e., ketamine), and modulation of kynurenine pathways (i.e., minocycline). Additionally, new and exciting directions in targeting inflammatory mechanisms in the treatment of depression are underway, and future investigation is also warranted to explore the utility of inflammation in diagnosing depression, guiding clinical treatment decision-making, and monitoring disease burden and relapse risk.']},\n",

They offer independent and shared contributions to pathways underpinning medical comorbidities including insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, obesity and cardiovascular disease - herein conceptualized as somatoprogression. This narrative review of human studies aims to summarize relationships between IO&NS pathways, neuroprogression and somatoprogression. Activated IO&NS pathways, implicated in the neuroprogression of psychiatric disorders, affect the pathogenesis of comorbidities including insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, obesity and hypertension, and by inference, metabolic syndrome. These conditions activate IO&NS pathways, exacerbating neuroprogression in psychiatric disorders. The processes whereby proinflammatory cytokines, nitrosative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, NADPH oxidase isoforms, PPARγ inactivation, SIRT1 deficiency and intracellular signalling pathways impact lipid metabolism and storage are considered. Through associations between body mass index, chronic neuroinflammation and FTO expression, activation of IO&NS pathways arising from somatoprogression may contribute to neuroprogression. Early evidence highlights the potential of adjuvants targeting IO&NS pathways for treating somatoprogression and neuroprogression.']},\n",

This study aimed to evaluate central measures of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity in rats submitted to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), as well as to investigate the relationship between BDNF levels and differentially processes. For this purpose, male Wistar rats were submitted to CUMS for six weeks. Based on a sucrose preference test (SPT), the animals were divided into anhedonic or non-anhedonic clusters. Afterwards, forced swim test (FST) and open field test (OFT) were performed, and the animals were euthanized. Brain tissue was collected, followed by quantification of oxidative damage, total antioxidant capacity and BDNF levels. Anhedonic behavior was evidenced in stress-susceptible animals through decreased sucrose preference. No differences were found in FST or OFT results. We observed increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus (HPC) of animals exposed to the CUMS protocol, accompanied by decreased total antioxidant capacity, despite the absence of oxidative damage to lipids and proteins. Moreover, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify proteins involved in oxidative stress and inflammation pathways, which were differentially expressed in anhedonic animals from other studies with similar experimental protocol. expressed proteins (DEP) involved in oxidative stress and inflammatory biological Anhedonic behavior was associated with peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX-1) up-regulation and down-regulation of proteins involved with apoptotic and inflammation signaling (RELA, ASK-1 and TAK-1) in the HPC. Taken together, these data suggest that BDNF and PRDX-1 might be involved in initial stress response, playing a compensatory role by preventing oxidative damage to lipids and proteins through the modulation of antioxidant defense after CUMS in anhedonic animals.']},\n",

However, the upstream mediator of mitochondrial injury and ER stress has not been identified and thus little drug is available to treat septic cardiomyopathy. Here, we explored the role of B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) in septic cardiomyopathy and figure out whether melatonin could attenuate sepsis-mediated myocardial depression via modulating BAP31. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to establish the septic cardiomyopathy model. Pathway analysis was performed via western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. Mitochondrial function and ER stress were detected via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot, and immunofluorescence. After exposure to LPS, cardiac function was reduced due to excessive inflammation response and extensive cardiomyocyte death. Mechanistically, melatonin treatment could dose-dependently improve cardiomyocyte viability via preserving mitochondrial function and reducing ER stress. Further, we found that BAP31 transcription was repressed by LPS whereas melatonin could restore BAP31 expression; this effect was dependent on the MAPK-ERK pathway. Inhibition of the ERK pathway and/or knockdown of BAP31 could attenuate the beneficial effects of melatonin on mitochondrial function and ER homeostasis under LPS stress. Altogether, our results indicate that ERK-BAP31 pathway could be used as a critical mediator for mitochondrial function and ER homeostasis in sepsis-related myocardial injury. Melatonin could stabilize BAP31 via the ERK pathway and thus contribute to the preservation of cardiac function in septic cardiomyopathy.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Inflammation is a natural defence response of the immune system against environmental insult, stress and injury, but hyper- and hypo-inflammatory responses can trigger diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation is involved in multiple psychiatric disorders. Using inflammation-related factors as biomarkers of psychiatric disorders requires the proof of reproducibility and specificity of the changes in different disorders, which remains to be established. We performed a cross-disorder study by systematically evaluating the meta-analysis results of inflammation-related factors in eight major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depression disorder (MDD), post-trauma stress disorder (PTSD), sleeping disorder (SD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and suicide. A total of 43 meta-analyses involving 704 publications on 44 inflammation-related factors were included in the study. We calculated the effect size and statistical power for every inflammation-related factor in each disorder. Our analyses showed that well-powered case-control studies provided more consistent results than underpowered studies when one factor was meta-analysed by different researchers. After removing underpowered studies, 30 of the 44 inflammation-related factors showed significant alterations in at least one disorder based on well-powered meta-analyses. Eleven of them changed in patients of more than two disorders when compared with the controls. A few inflammation-related factors showed unique changes in specific disorders (e.g., IL-4 increased in BD, decreased in suicide, but had no change in MDD, ASD, PTSD and SCZ). MDD had the largest number of changes while SD has the least. Clustering analysis showed that closely related disorders share similar patterns of inflammatory changes, as genome-wide genetic studies have found. According to the effect size obtained from the meta-analyses, 13 inflammation-related factors would need <50 cases and 50 controls to achieve 80% power to show significant differences (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0016) between patients and controls. Changes in different states of MDD, SCZ or BD were also observed in various comparisons. Studies comparing first-episode SCZ to controls may have more reproducible findings than those comparing pre- and post-treatment results. Longitudinal, system-wide studies of inflammation regulation that can differentiate trait- and state-specific changes will be needed to establish valuable biomarkers.']},\n",

In the present study, the inflammasome activity and oxidative stress status in untreated and antidepressant-treated MDD patients were compared to the healthy group. Blood samples were taken from 20 MDD patients receiving treatment, 20 first-episode MDD patients not receiving treatment, and 20 healthy controls. The expression level of NLRP3 and caspase-1 was measured by real-time PCR and the serum TAC and MDA were examined in the patients and the control groups. The results showed that the mRNA level of NLRP3 and caspase-1 genes was significantly elevated in MDD groups compared with that in the healthy volunteers (P\\u2009<\\u20090.005). The expression level of NLRP3 and caspase-1 has slightly decreased in the treated group compared with that in the untreated one, but it was not a meaningful decrease. Moreover, the serum MDA was significantly higher and TAC statistically was lower in untreated MDD patients compared with those in the healthy control group (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001). It can be concluded that NLRP3 inflammasome is upregulated in MDD patients. Statistically significant reduction in the level of TAC along with increased lipid peroxidation was detectable in MDD patient's plasma. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the treated and non-treated groups in terms of oxidative stress (P\\u2009=\\u20090.6, P\\u2009=\\u20090.1).

Legumain, a lysosomal cysteine protease, plays an important role in cancer, atherosclerosis, inflammation and other pathological conditions. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the activation of legumain aggravates the cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we explored the role of legumain in cognitive impairment of stressed mice. Legumain knockout (legumain KO) and wildtype (WT) mice were divided into four groups: control group, chronic mild unpredictable stressed (CUS) group, legumain KO group and legumain KO\\u2009+\\u2009CUS group. Our results demonstrated that CUS (4 weeks) induced cognitive impairment in mice effectively based on Morris water maze (MWM) test and novel object recognition (NOR) test and decreased the synaptic plasticity. Additionally, CUS exposure significantly decreased the expression of hippocampal synapse related proteins and the cell density in the DG region, accompanied by increasing the expression of hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and promoting the activation of microglia in the hippocampus. Legumain KO distinctly restored the CUS-induced negative effects on the indicators mentioned above. In conclusion, our results suggested that legumain may be an effective therapeutic target for cognitive impairment as was seen within the CUS model and legumain KO reduced the level of neuroinflammation, thereby improving the hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment of stressed mice.']},\n",

Here, we investigate the immune-triggered hyperexcitability in the cerebellum on a wider scope. Activated microglia via exposure to bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide or heat-killed Gram-negative bacteria induce a potentiation of the intrinsic excitability in Purkinje neurons, which is suppressed by microglia-activity inhibitor and microglia depletion. An inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), released from microglia via toll-like receptor 4, triggers this plasticity. Our two-photon FRET ATP imaging shows an increase in ATP concentration following endotoxin exposure. Both TNF-α and ATP secretion facilitate synaptic transmission. Region-specific inflammation in the cerebellum in\\xa0vivo shows depression- and autistic-like behaviors. Furthermore, both TNF-α inhibition and microglia depletion revert such behavioral abnormality. Resting-state functional MRI reveals overconnectivity between the inflamed cerebellum and the prefrontal neocortical regions. Thus, immune activity in the cerebellum induces neuronal hyperexcitability and disruption of psychomotor behaviors in animals.']},\n",

To clarify the role of TLR2 in the pathological process of AD, in the present study, TLR2 knockout plus APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mice (AD-TLR2KO) were generated. Neurobehavioral tests and brain MRI scan were conducted on mice at the age of 12 months. Additionally, neuron loss was evaluated using NeuN staining. Amyloid β protein (Aβ), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), endogenous ligands for TLR2, and the activation of downstream signaling of TLR2 in mouse brains were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blots. The results demonstrated that TLR2 deficit induced learning disabilities, decreased spontaneous activity, increased anxiety and depression, and led to white matter damage (WMD), brain atrophy, loss of neurons, and glial activation. Moreover, TLR2 deficit aggravated impaired neurobehavioral functions and WMD in AD mice, but did not affect the Aβ deposition in mouse brains. Our data indicate that the genomic deletion of TLR2 impairs neurobehavioral functions, induces WMD and brain atrophy, and increases the activation of astrocytes, which in turn aggravate the symptoms of AD through a non-Aβ mechanism.\"]},\n",

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 159 patients included in the cluster analysis who were ≥60 years and who underwent four-month follow-up. The first cluster contained 50 patients, the second cluster contained 74 patients, and the third cluster contained 35 patients. Clinical parameters were identified from electronic health records and patient questionnaires. Laboratory tests, anthropometric measurements, the number of chronic diseases, the number of prescribed medications were recorded. Frailty was determined using the five criteria of Fried's phenotype -model. Levels of anxiety and depression were recorded using the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score assessed cognitive impairment. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of frailty and pre-frailty. RESULTS Three overlapping clusters of phenotypes predicted frailty, and included obesity (n=50), multimorbidity with mental impairment (n=74), and decline in renal function with cognitive impairment (n=35). The predictors of outcome included increasing age, number of chronic diseases, inflammation, anemia, anxiety, and cognitive impairment, and reduced muscle mass. CONCLUSIONS In patients ≥60 years in a primary healthcare setting, multimorbidity predictors of pre-frailty and frailty included a decline in cognitive function and renal function.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The number of patients with mental illnesses is rapidly increasing, and daily lifestyle is closely associated with the development of symptoms. It is suggested that inflammatory molecules derived from microglia play crucial roles for the pathophysiology of depression. In the present study, we discovered that leucine-histidine (LH) dipeptide suppressed activation of primary microglia. The effects of LH dipeptide orally administered were measured using tail suspension test (TST) in mice injected with lipopolysaccharide and social interaction test in mice received social defeat stress. LH dipeptide reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation in microglia. Orally administered LH dipeptide was delivered to the brain and suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain and concomitant depression-like behavior in the TST. Moreover, oral administration of LH dipeptide suppressed the induction of depression- and anxiety-like behaviors induced by repeated social defeat stress. These results indicate that LH dipeptide suppressed the activation of microglia and ameliorated depression-associated emotional disturbances. Further, we found that LH dipeptide was abundant in various fermented products. Together with previous epidemiological reports that daily intake of these fermented foods is negatively associated with the incidence of psychiatric diseases, our findings suggest that food rich in LH dipeptide may improve mental health.']},\n",

In addition to the emotional disturbances, high incidences of painful symptoms such as headache and joint pain have also been reported following IFN-α treatment. The endocannabinoid system plays an important role in emotional and nociceptive processing, however it is unknown whether repeated IFN-α administration induces alterations in this system. The present study investigated nociceptive responding in the IFN-α-induced mouse model of depression and associated changes in the endocannabinoid system. Furthermore, the effects of modulating peripheral endocannabinoid tone on inflammatory pain-related behaviour in the IFN-α model was examined. Repeated IFN-α administration (8000\\u202fIU/g/day) to male C57/Bl6 mice increased immobility in the forced swim test and reduced sucrose preference, without altering body weight gain or locomotor activity, confirming development of the depressive-like phenotype. There was no effect of repeated IFN-α administration on latency to respond in the hot plate test on day 4 or 7 of treatment, however, formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour was significantly increased in IFN-α treated mice following 8\\u202fdays of IFN-α administration. 2-Arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) levels in the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and rostroventromedial medulla (RVM), and anandamide (AEA) levels in the RVM, were significantly increased in IFN-α-, but not saline-, treated mice following formalin administration. There was no change in endocannabinoid levels in the prefrontal cortex, spinal cord or paw tissue between saline- or IFNα-treated mice in the presence or absence of formalin.

       "  'abstract': ['Piperlongumine, an alkaloid compound extracted from Peper longum L, has been reported to produce neuroprotective effects in the brain and exert various pharmacological activities such as antitumor, antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the antidepressant-like effects and the possible mechanism of action of piperlongumine in a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model. We found that, with venlafaxine as a positive control, orally administered piperlongumine (12.5 and 25\\u2009mg/kg) for 7\\u2009days, not a single dose, significantly reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test, but did not alter locomotor activity in the open field test, indicating that piperlongumine has antidepressant-like effects without nonspecific motor changes. Then, using the CUS model of depression, piperlongumine was administrated orally for 4\\u2009weeks, followed by sucrose preference and forced swimming tests to evaluate the depressive-like behaviors. We found that piperlongumine reversed both the decreased sucrose preference and increased immobility time in rats exposed to CUS. In addition, piperlongumine also reversed the increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels in the hippocampus of rats in the CUS model. Altogether, the present study demonstrated that piperlongumine exhibits the antidepressant-like effects in rats, which may be mediated by the inhibition of the neuronal inflammation in the hippocampus.']},\n",

With data from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (1998-2007), we used Cox proportional hazards regression to separately evaluate associations of baseline PA level with mortality, dementia/cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), and depressive symptoms, and we estimated the mediating effects of inflammatory markers in additive hazard models. A low level of PA (<35 metabolic equivalent of task-hours/week) was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20, 1.88), dementia/CIND (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.96), and depressive symptoms (HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.52). A low PA level added 512 (95% CI: -34, 1,058) cases of dementia/CIND per 100,000 person-years at risk (direct effect), while, through a mediating path, interleukin 6 (IL-6) added another 49 (95% CI: 5, 94) cases, or 9% of the total effect. For mortality, 8%-10% of the PA total effect was mediated through IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), or TNF-α receptors. None of the inflammatory markers mediated the association between PA and depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that antiinflammation (especially as assessed by IL-6 and TNF-α levels) may partly explain how PA protects against dementia/CIND and mortality.']},\n",

Methods This was an observational study of early preterm birth (PTB) occurring between 20 0/7 and 34 6/7 weeks of gestation. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured 1 month post-partum. CRP measurements were compared by birth etiology. Results A total of 399 women were analyzed. Distribution of birth etiology was 35% (n\\u2009=\\u2009138) preterm labor (PTL), 28% (n\\u2009=\\u2009115) preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM), and 37% (n\\u2009=\\u2009141) indicated preterm birth (IPTB). Serum CRP varied by birth etiology (P\\u2009=\\u20090.036). Women with pPROM had elevated median CRP levels compared to women with PTL (P\\u2009=\\u20090.037).

Despite many treatment options are available, the frequent occurrence of unacceptable adverse effects further supports the research toward nutraceuticals and herbal preparations, among which Tanacetum parthenium and Salix alba showed promising anti-inflammatory and neuro-modulatory activities. The impact of extract treatment on astrocyte viability, spontaneous migration and apoptosis was evaluated. Anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant effects were investigated on isolated rat cortexes exposed to a neurotoxic stimulus. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, nitrite levels and 5-HT turnover were evaluated, as well. A proteomic analysis was focused on specific neuronal proteins and a fingerprint analysis was carried out on selected phenolic compounds. Both extracts appeared able to exert in vitro anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. S. alba and T. parthenium extracts reduced LDH release, nitrite levels and 5-HT turnover induced by neurotoxic stimulus. The downregulation of selected proteins suggest a neurotoxicity, which could be ascribed to an elevated content of gallic acid in both S. alba and T. parthenium extracts. Concluding, both extracts exert neuroprotective effects, although the downregulation of key proteins involved in neuron physiology suggest caution in their use as food supplements.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease with a median survival of only 5-7 yr. PAH is characterized by remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature causing reduced pulmonary arterial compliance (PAC) and increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), ultimately resulting in right ventricular failure and death. Better therapies for PAH will require a paradigm shift in our understanding of the early pathophysiology. PAC decreases before there is an increase in the PVR. Unfortunately, present treatment has little effect on PAC. The loss of compliance correlates with extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis in the pulmonary vessels, which have been linked to chronic perivascular inflammation and immune dysregulation. However, what initiates the perivascular inflammation and immune dysregulation in PAH is unclear. Alteration of the gut microbiota composition and function underlies the level of immunopathogenic involvement in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and depression, among others. In this review, we discuss evidence that raises the possibility of an etiologic role for changes in the gut and circulating microbiome in the initiation of perivascular inflammation in the early pathogenesis of PAH.']},\n",

Finally, our findings showed that the extract of MS relieved inflammatory stress induced by LPS injury, indicated by the down-regulation of IL-1β/6 and TNF-α, and up-regulation of IL-4 level both in vitro and in vivo.

       "   'Changes in the gut microbiome increase the release of microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which activate a gut inflammatory response. Gut pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate the afferent vagal nerve which in turn impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis inducing symptoms associated with depression. Recent research suggests that gut inflammation can induce neuroinflammation which, in turn, stimulates microglia activation and the kynurenine pathway and can activate systemic inflammation-inducing depressive symptoms. Promoting a healthy diet and lifestyle changes, limiting exposure to pesticides, limiting medications that affect the microbiome and the use of such things pre/probiotics and other interventions may complement existing efforts to curb the rise in depression. Alternative and complementary therapies may serve as effective treatments in adolescents with depression.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The contribution of depression to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease includes autonomic disturbances, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, carbohydrate craving, and impaired fibrinolysis. There is evidence that serotonergic antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) restore the fibrinolytic profile. Contrary to common belief, such antidepressants do not affect platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate or adrenaline but reduce platelet adhesion to collagen. Since platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI binds to fibrin, it is possible that fibrinolytic properties of serotonergic antidepressants could impair platelet adhesion to collagen. The profibrinolytic and antiplatelet properties of serotonergic antidepressants help explain the increased risk of gastrointestinal, intracranial, and surgical bleeding in patients using these medications. Studies evaluating the impact of antidepressants on thrombotic and cardiovascular risk have yielded contradictory results. Corroborating the hypothesis that serotonergic antidepressants have profibrinolytic and antiplatelet properties, some authors showed that these medications prevent both cardiovascular and thromboembolic events. Others showed an increased risk of ischemic stroke, cardiac events and thromboembolic disease. Silent brain infarction may present in some elders with depressive symptoms, so it is presumed that antidepressants are prescribed for subclinical stroke patients. Another explanation for the increased risk of cardiovascular and thromboembolic events reported by some authors in individuals taking antidepressants includes antidepressant side effects such as sedation and weight gain and depression comorbidities such as anxiety, obesity and hyperhomocysteinemia. In conclusion, we suggest that serotonergic antidepressants be considered weak anticoagulants. We also suggest that depressed patients with comorbidities increasing the risk of cardiovascular and thromboembolic disease be recommended to follow a balanced diet and engage in physical activity, such as daily walking.']},\n",

Collectively these microorganisms contribute to the microbiome and often reside in the gut. The gut microbiome plays an important role in the body and contributes to digestive health, the immune system, and brain function. The gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system through the vagal pathways as well as the endocrine or immune pathways. Changes in the proportion or diversity of the microbiota can have an impact on normal physiology and has been implicated in inflammation, depression, obesity, and addiction. Several animal studies suggest the involvement of gut microbiome in the regulation of pain, emotion, and cognition. Alcoholism has been linked with gut microbiome dysbiosis and thus can have deleterious effects on the gut-brain axis balance. Gut microbiome produces important metabolites such as gastrointestinal hormones, short chain fatty acids, precursors to the neuroactive compounds and neurotransmitters that impact the physiology and normal functioning of the body. The microbiome imbalance has been correlated with behavioral changes and alcohol dependence in the host. The objective of this study is to elucidate the link between alcohol induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and any behavioral impact that could incur. A thorough literature search of various databases was conducted to gather data for the alcohol prompted gut microbiome dysbiosis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Several lines of evidence indicate that aberrations in immune-inflammatory pathways may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Here, we propose a novel theoretical framework that was previously developed for major depression and bipolar disorder, namely, the compensatory immune-regulatory reflex system (CIRS), as applied to the neuro-immune pathophysiology of schizophrenia and its phenotypes, including first-episode psychosis (FEP), acute relapses, chronic and treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), comorbid depression, and deficit schizophrenia. These schizophrenia phenotypes and manifestations are accompanied by increased production of positive acute-phase proteins, including haptoglobin and α2-macroglobulin, complement factors, and macrophagic M1 (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), T helper (Th)-1 (interferon-γ and IL-2R), Th-2 (IL-4, IL-5), Th-17 (IL-17), and T regulatory (Treg; IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1) cytokines, cytokine-induced activation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway, and chemokines, including CCL-11 (eotaxin), CCL-2, CCL-3, and CXCL-8. While the immune profiles in the different schizophrenia phenotypes indicate the activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), there are simultaneous signs of CIRS activation, including increased levels of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1RA), sIL-2R and tumor necrosis factor-α receptors, Th-2 and Treg phenotypes with increased IL-4 and IL-10 production, and increased levels of TRYCATs and haptoglobin, α2-macroglobulin, and other acute-phase reactants, which have immune-regulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Signs of activated IRS and CIRS pathways are also detected in TRS, chronic, and deficit schizophrenia, indicating that these conditions are accompanied by a new homeostatic setpoint between upregulated IRS and CIRS components. In FEP, increased baseline CIRS activity is a protective factor that may predict favorable clinical outcomes. Moreover, impairments in the CIRS are associated with deficit schizophrenia and greater impairments in semantic and episodic memory. It is concluded that CIRS plays a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia by negatively regulating the primary IRS and contributing to recovery from the acute phase of illness. Therefore, components of the CIRS may offer promising therapeutic targets for schizophrenia.']},\n",

The utilization of animal models of anxiety and stress can improve our knowledge of the pathology of these disorders as well as aiding in the identification of pharmacological therapeutic targets. The involvement of inflammation in the pathology of stress-related disorders is widely acknowledged. This study was therefore undertaken to assess depressive and anxiety-like behavior as well as neuroinflammation in acute-isolated rats. The study design comprised two main groups:1) rats in acute isolation (one rat per cage) and 2) standard housing (two rats per cage). Within ten days of acute isolation, we carried behavioral tests including Sucrose Neophobia (SNP), Sucrose Preference Test (SPT), Open field (OPF), and a Forced swim test (FST). In a separate set of experiments, we examined the molecular changes after five days of isolations, we examined the mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and inflammatory markers in the hippocampal brain region. We found that acute social isolation did not have profound functional effects and the behavioral analysis revealed similarities between the isolated and standard housed rats. However, the molecular studies showed a significant increase in TLRs. An increase in Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was observed in the hippocampus of isolated rats but not the control rats. The results suggest that acute environmental isolation does not significantly affect depressive and anxiety-like behavior but does contribute to upregulations in neuroinflammatory responses. This indicates the initiation of neuronal insults following exposure to short-term isolation.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Background In recent years, increased stress in human life has a dual effect on brain and body physiology. Chronic stress takes a toll on physiology as well as on quality of life, ultimately leading to affective disorders. Rodent models are indispensable tools for studying the etiology and progress of depression. C-reactive protein has been proposed as a novel inflammatory marker. Methods Rats were divided into control and experimental stress groups (n = 6 each). The experimental group consisted of rats that were exposed to a set of chronic unpredictable stressors for 15 days. At the end of the 15th day, the animals were anesthetized, and blood samples were collected through cardiac puncture. Then the blood samples were analyzed for selected biochemical and oxidative stress parameters. Results Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (p < 0.0001), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (p < 0.001), serum malondialdehyde (p < 0.0001), total antioxidant level (p < 0.0001), and serum cortisol (p < 0.0001) were significantly increased in the stressed group when compared with the control group. C-reactive protein significantly (p < 0.0001) increased in the stressed group when compared with the control group. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that chronic unpredictable stress ameliorated depression-like behavior, which might have caused the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing the imbalance in the biochemical and oxidative parameters increasing the inflammatory markers. The inflammation-induced model of the chronic unpredictable stress model of comorbid depression might provide a variety of new targets for antidepressant therapies.']},\n",

No association was found between anxiety or depression and CRP in unadjusted or multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses, nor was there evidence of moderation by continuous BMI, BMI class, or obesity. Future studies on the relationship between anxiety and CRP should utilize larger general population samples or populations with a high prevalence of anxiety.

       "  'abstract': [\"Depression affects at least 322 million people globally, or approximately 4.4% of the world's population. While the earnestness of researchers and clinicians to understand and treat depression is not waning, the number of individuals suffering from depression continues to increase over and above the rate of global population growth. There is a sincere need for a paradigm shift. Research in the past decade is beginning to take a more holistic approach to understanding depression etiology and treatment, integrating multiple body systems into whole-body conceptualizations of this mental health affliction. Evidence supports the hypothesis that the gut microbiome, or the collective trillions of microbes inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract, is an important factor determining both the risk of development of depression and persistence of depressive symptoms. This review discusses recent advances in both rodent and human research that explore bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the immune, endocrine, and central nervous systems implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of depression. Through interactions with circulating inflammatory markers and hormones, afferent and efferent neural systems, and other, more niche, pathways, the gut microbiome can affect behavior to facilitate the development of depression, exacerbate current symptoms, or contribute to treatment and resilience. While the challenge of depression may be the direst mental health crisis of our age, new discoveries in the gut microbiome, when integrated into a holistic perspective, hold great promise for the future of positive mental health.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Several studies indicate that negative and cognitive symptoms are determining factors of functioning in patients with schizophrenia. However, they do not usually include biological aspects, such as inflammatory markers. The current prospective study aims to identify clinical and biological factors predicting real-world functioning, at baseline and at one-year follow-up, of outpatients in an early stage of schizophrenia. Sample consist of 73 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia, of which 57 completed the one-year follow-up. Accurate psychopathology, functioning, and cognitive assessments were performed at baseline and follow-up (Positive and Negative Syndrome, Brief Negative Symptom, Calgary Depression, Personal and Social Performance Scales, and MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery). Biological biomarkers including anthropometric data and blood parameters were collected. Pearson correlation and multiple regression analyses including potential confounding factors were performed. Negative symptoms (especially asociality and avolition), along with the inflammatory biomarker interleukin-2, are the most important determining factors of poor real-world functioning in early-stage schizophrenia. The previous functioning, along with baseline cognitive performance in attention and vigilance, predicts functioning at one-year follow-up in these patients. Strategies aimed at improving negative and cognitive symptoms, as well as modifying certain inflammatory pathways, should be the targets to achieve functional recovery in the first years of schizophrenia.']},\n",

Our previous studies have shown the antidepressant properties of apelin, but the mechanism was unkown. This study was performed to verify whether the antidepressant effect of apelin was related to its anti-inflammation effect in the central nervous system. To achieve our aim, we selected the co-treatment of chronic stress and LPS to induced an inflammatory process in rats. The effect of this co-treatment was evaluated through the expression of inflammatory markers and glial cell activation. LPS injection co-treated with unpredictable chronic mild stress resulted in the activation of microglial cell and astrocyte, expression of inflammatory markers and depressive behaviors. Treatment with apelin significantly attenuates the deleterious effects in these rats. Our results showed that apelin improved depressive phenotype and decreased the activation of glial cells in stress co-treatment group. The down-regulations of p-NF-κB and p-IKKβ suggested that the effects are possibly mediated by inhibition of the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response. These findings speculated that intracerebroventricular injection of apelin could be a therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression, and the antidepressant function of apelin may closely associated with its alleviation in neuroinflammation.']},\n",

Therefore, discovering effective means of counteracting detrimental inflammatory mediators in the brain could help alter aging-related disease onset and progression. Fish oil and marine-derived omega-3, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3) have shown promising anti-inflammatory effects both systemically and centrally. More specifically, krill oil (KO), extracted from small Antarctic crustaceans, is an alternative type of LC n-3 with reported health benefits including improvement of spatial memory and learning, memory loss, systemic inflammation and depression symptoms. Similar to the more widely studied fish oil, KO contains the long chain fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which are essential for basic brain functions. Moreover, the phospholipid bound nature of fatty acids found in KO improves bioavailability and efficiency of absorption, thus supporting the belief that KO may offer a superior method of dietary n-3 delivery. Finally, KO contains astaxanthin, an antioxidant capable of reducing potentially excessive oxidative stress and inflammation within the brain. This review will discuss the potential benefits of KO over other marine-based LC n-3 on brain inflammation and cognitive function in the context of high fat diets and aging.\"]},\n",

This has increased the incidence of age-related, non-AIDS comorbidities in this population. One of the most common comorbidities is depression, which is also associated with cognitive impairment and a number of neuropathologies. In older people living with HIV, treating these overlapping disorders is complex, often creating pill burden or adverse drug-drug interactions that can exacerbate these neurologic disorders. Depression, NeuroHIV and many of the neuropsychiatric therapeutics used to treat them impact the dopaminergic system, suggesting that dopaminergic dysfunction may be a common factor in the development of these disorders. Further, changes in dopamine can influence the development of inflammation and the regulation of immune function, which are also implicated in the progression of NeuroHIV and depression. Little is known about the optimal clinical management of drug-drug interactions between cART drugs and antidepressants, particularly in regard to dopamine in older people living with HIV. This review will discuss those interactions, first examining the etiology of NeuroHIV and depression in older adults, then discussing the interrelated effects of dopamine and inflammation on these disorders, and finally reviewing the activity and interactions of cART drugs and antidepressants on each of these factors. Developing better strategies to manage these comorbidities is critical to the health of the aging, HIV-infected population, as the older population may be particularly vulnerable to drug-drug interactions affecting dopamine.']},\n",

Together, these two leading causes of death and disability significantly contribute to the global burden of healthcare costs. However, there are no drug treatments for TBI and antidepressants are considered off-label for depression in patients with TBI. In molecular profiling studies of rat hippocampus after experimental TBI, we found that TBI altered the expression of a subset of small, non-coding, microRNAs (miRNAs). One known neuroprotective compound (17β-estradiol, E2), and two experimental neuroprotective compounds (JM6 and PMI-006), reversed the effects of TBI on miRNAs. Subsequent in silico analyses revealed that the injury-altered miRNAs were predicted to regulate genes involved in depression. Thus, we hypothesized that drug-induced miRNA profiles can be used to identify compounds with antidepressant properties. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined miRNA expression in hippocampi of injured rats treated with one of three known antidepressants (imipramine, fluoxetine and sertraline). Bioinformatic analyses revealed that TBI, potentially via its effects on multiple regulatory miRNAs, dysregulated transcriptional networks involved in neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, and circadian rhythms- networks known to adversely affect mood, cognition and memory. As did E2, JM6, and PMI-006, all three antidepressants reversed the effects of TBI on multiple injury-altered miRNAs. Furthermore, JM6 reduced TBI-induced inflammation in the hippocampus and depression-like behavior in the forced swim test; these are both properties of classic antidepressant drugs. Our results support the hypothesis that miRNA expression signatures can identify neuroprotective and antidepressant properties of novel compounds and that there is substantial overlap between neuroprotection and antidepressant properties.']},\n",

Unfortunately, their clinical use is limited by severe adverse effects such as insulin resistance, cardiometabolic diseases, muscle and skin atrophies, osteoporosis, and depression. Glucocorticoids exert their effects by binding to the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), a ligand-activated transcription factor which both positively, and negatively regulates gene expression. Extensive research during the past several years has uncovered novel mechanisms by which the GR activates and represses its target genes. Genome-wide studies and mouse models have provided valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory gene regulation by GR. This review focusses on newly identified target genes and GR co-regulators that are important for its anti-inflammatory effects in innate immune cells, as well as mutations within the GR itself that shed light on its transcriptional activity.

As a result, patients with pancytopenia are more prone to anemia, infections, and excessive bleeding. Pancytopenia can be caused by medications or drug interactions that suppress the bone marrow. This case report highlights a drug interaction between allopurinol and mercaptopurine which led to pancytopenia and septic infection, resulting in the patient's death. This could easily have been avoided if a clinical pharmacist had been consulted. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old female patient with a past medical history of gout, depression, back pain, and type 2 diabetes was recently diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and was discharged with a new prescription of mercaptopurine. After 2 months of concurrent use of allopurinol and mercaptopurine, she developed infected foot ulcers, which progressed rabidly to sepsis. At the time, her laboratory findings confirmed pancytopenia. Despite treatment, the patient died. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrates the importance of consulting a clinical pharmacist in order to avoid such medical error. The dose of mercaptopurine should be reduced to 25% of the recommended dose when it is given concurrently with allopurinol to reduce the risk of pancytopenia. Health care providers should think about the significant role of clinical pharmacy services. In our case, there were no clinical pharmacist involved in the care of this patient, and as a result of such negligence, the patient lost her life.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis hyperactivity and inflammation are thought to be prominent in the aetiology of depression. Although meta-analyses have confirmed this relationship, there is considerable variability in the effect sizes across studies. This could be attributed to a differential role of such biological systems in somatic versus cognitive-affective depressive symptoms which remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, most longitudinal research to date has focused on transient rather than persistent depressive symptoms. In the current study, we investigated the associations of hair cortisol and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) with the longitudinal persistence and dimensions (cognitive-affective versus somatic) of depressive symptoms over a 14-year period using Trait-State-Occasion (TSO) structural equation modelling. The data came from a large sample of older adults from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Depressive symptoms were assessed from wave 1 (2002-03) to wave 8 (2016-17). Hair cortisol (N\\u2009=\\u20094761) and plasma CRP (N\\u2009=\\u20095784) were measured in wave 6 (2012-13). Covariates included demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, chronic disease, and medication data. Our results revealed that higher cortisol and CRP levels were significantly associated with persistent depressive symptoms across the study period. Notably, both biomarkers exhibited stronger relationships with somatic than with cognitive-affective symptoms. The associations with somatic symptoms were also independent of relevant confounding factors. In contrast, their associations with cognitive-affective symptoms were weak after adjustment for all covariates. These distinct associations reveal the importance of considering symptom-specific effects in future studies on pathophysiological mechanisms. Ultimately, this will have the potential to advance the search for biomarkers of depression and facilitate more targeted treatments.']},\n",

Previous evidence at the DNA level as well as on the serum protein level suggests that the role of inflammation in MDD pathology is stronger in patients with hyperphagia during an active episode. Which inflammatory pathways differ in MDD patients with hyperphagia inflammatory pathways in terms of gene expression is unknown. We analyzed whole-blood gene expression profiles of 881 current MDD cases and 331 controls from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). The MDD patients were stratified according to patients with hyperphagia (characterized by increased appetite and/or weight, N\\u2009=\\u2009246) or hypophagia (characterized by decreased appetite and/or weight, N\\u2009=\\u2009342).

The majority of the pathways were significantly (FDR\\u2009<\\u20090.1) enriched in the expression profiles of MDD cases with hyperphagia, including top pathways related to factors responsible for the onset of inflammatory response ('caspase', 'GATA3', 'NFAT', and 'inflammasomes' pathways). Only two pathways ('adaptive immune system' and 'IL-8- and CXCR2-mediated signaling') were enriched in the MDD with hypophagia subgroup, these were also enriched in the total current MDD group and the group with hyperphagia. This confirms the importance of inflammation in MDD pathology of patients with hyperphagia, and suggests that distinguishing more uniform MDD phenotypes can help in finding their pathophysiological basis.\"]},\n",

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the effect of escitalopram on peripheral inflammatory cascades in iodoacetamide-induced colitis associated with depressive behavior in ovariectomized rats. Moreover, the role of α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in mediating the anti-colitic effect of escitalopram was examined using a nicotinic receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine citrate. Colitis was induced by intracolonic injection of 4% iodoacetamide in ovariectomized rats. Escitalopram (10\\xa0mg/kg/day, i.p.) was then injected for 1\\xa0week and several parameters including macroscopic (colon mass index and ulcerative area), microscopic (histopathology and scoring), and biochemical (myeloperoxidase and tumor necrosis factor-α) were determined. Colitis induction in ovariectomized rats resulted in a marked increase in colon mass index, ulcerative area, histopathological scoring, myeloperoxidase activity and tumor necrosis factor-α levels. These effects were ameliorated by escitalopram, even in the presence of methyllycaconitine indicating that α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor does not mediate the anti-inflammatory effect of escitalopram. The present study revealed the beneficial effect of escitalopram in iodoacetamide induced colitis in ovariectomized rats and suggests that it may represent a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, especially in patients with or at high risk of depressive behavior.']},\n",

The inflammation hypothesis of depression suggests that cytokines play a key role in the pathophysiology of MDD and alterations in peripheral cytokine levels are associated with antidepressant treatment outcome. Present meta-analysis aimed to examine the association between baseline peripheral cytokine levels and the response to antidepressant treatment and to evaluate whether changes of cytokine levels were associated with the response to antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD. Human-based studies published in any language in peer-reviewed journals were systematically searched from the PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases, from inception up to October 2018. The search terms included cytokine, depressive disorder and antidepressant and their synonyms. Case-control or case-case studies reporting on levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, CRP, TNF-α, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, MIP-1α, and Eotaxin-1 in patients with MDD based on validated depression scales both before and after antidepressant treatment were included. Of 7408 identified records, 44 studies met inclusion. Standardized mean differences in each cytokine were evaluated, and random-effects meta-analyses were performed. MDD patients who responded to antidepressant treatment had lower baseline IL-8 levels than the nonresponders (Hedge's g\\u2009=\\u2009-0.28; 95%CI, -0.43 to -0.13; P\\u2009=\\u20090.0003; FDR\\u2009=\\u20090.004).

       "  'abstract': ['Brain is an organ with the highest lipid concentration in the body. Cellular membrane lipids can affect both the positioning and the functioning of membrane proteins, thus regulating several cell actions. Changes in the lipid composition of cell membrane can modulate the microenvironment and consequently the function of its proteins, e.g. neurotransmission. Some of the first studies on the subject have shown a negative correlation between serum cholesterol levels and depression, suicidality and behavioral disorders. Several studies -but not all- have found decreased concentrations of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3-PUFA) in plasma or erythrocyte membranes of patients with depression, bipolar disorder or after a suicide attempt. In some cases, positive results after their administration have been reported. The effect of ω-3-PUFA in affective disorders is attributed to their action on neurotransmission, neuroplasticity as well as to their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. Besides, decreased levels of ω-3-PUFA have been found in erythrocytes or platelets of schizophrenic patients. Some studies have shown in schizophrenics an increased rate of membrane phospholipids breakdown and a decreased ratio of ω-3-PUFA incorporation in phospholipids, possibly because of increased activity of phospholipase A2, an enzyme with crucial role in signaling transduction. Deficient dietetic ingestion of ω-3-PUFA may increase the risk for development of schizophrenia, while a diet rich in ω-3-PUFA may have a preventive role for the disease or improve its course. Although there is no evidence for their action as a monotherapy, they may be useful as an add-on therapy to drug treatment. Some authors suggest that abnormal sphingolipid metabolism, leading to accumulation of ceramides, may be responsible for the development of mood and anxiety disorders, as well as for induction of inflammation or oxidative stress, mechanisms possibly responsible for the physical symptoms of depression. Some drugs seem to combine inhibition of sphingomyelinase (an enzyme catalyzing the production of ceramides) and antidepressant effect. Despite the multitude of related studies, many aspects of the subject remain obscure. Current research focuses on the validity of preventive (especially in the perinatal period) or therapeutic administration of ω-3-PUFA as well as to the pharmacological manipulation of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (e.g. sphingomyelinase) for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.']},\n",

Very commonly, pain is a manifestation of active disease and because untreated RA can result in joint deformities, the current evaluation of pain has largely focused on inflammation. In addition, treatment has centered on the premise of reducing disease activity with the hopes of halting worsening damage, preventing future deformities, and ultimately providing pain relief for the patient. Yet research shows that all patients with RA, but women\\xa0in particular, often suffer from increased mechanical pain and fibromyalgia, as well as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and disability, which add to the burden of the illness. Determining and addressing alternative pain triggers as well as understanding the psychosocial burden of RA is key in treating patients, especially in those who may not improve with traditional pharmacotherapy.']},\n",

However, not all individuals develop the negative consequences of emotional stress due to different stress coping strategies and resilience to stressful stimuli. In this review, we discuss individual differences in coping styles and the potential mechanisms that contribute to individual vulnerability to stress, such as parameters of the immune system and oxidative state. Initial differences in inflammatory and oxidative processes determine resistance to stress and stress-related disorders via the alteration of neurotransmitter content in the brain and biological fluids. Differences in coping styles may serve as possible predictors of resistance to stress and stress-related disorders, even before stressful conditions. The investigation of natural variabilities in stress resilience may allow the development of new methods for preventive medicine and the personalized treatment of stress-related conditions.']},\n",

The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded and evaluated with special focus on S-T segment changes (depression or elevation), T-wave alterations, AV block and ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. On day 6 (i.e., the day after the last injection day), the animals were sacrificed and the hearts were harvested and evaluated for necrosis using hematoxylin and eosin staining. In addition, Akt protein expression levels and BAX/BCL2 ratio were determined by western blotting. Our results showed that hesperidin decreased cardiac necrosis. In animals treated with hesperidin 100\\u2009mg/kg, Akt protein expression was increased, while the BAX/BCL2 ratio was significantly decreased.

In the neuronal death and disease progression, inflammation is known to play an important role. Our previous study on acute-phase protein serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) overexpressed mice showed that the liver-derived SAA1 accumulated in the brain by crossing the brain blood barrier (BBB) and trigger the depressive-like behavior on mouse. Since SAA1 involved in immune responses in other diseases, we focused on the possibility that SAA1 may exacerbate the neuronal inflammation related to Alzheimer's disease. A APP/SAA overexpressed double transgenic mouse was generated using amyloid precursor protein overexpressed (APP)-c105 mice and SAA1 overexpressed mice to examine the function of SAA1 in Aβ abundant condition. Comparisons between APP and APP/SAA1 transgenic mice showed that SAA1 exacerbated amyloid aggregation and glial activation; which lead to the memory decline. Behavior tests also supported this result. Overall, overexpression of SAA1 intensified the neuronal inflammation in amyloid abundant condition and causes the greater memory decline compared to APP mice, which only expresses Aβ 1-42.\"]},\n",

We applied a systematic bibliographic search in PubMed and EMBASE for articles published prior to 20 December 2017. This meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and R 3.4.3, and means and standard deviations were calculated in fixed- or random-effects models based on the results of the Q-test. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the stability of the results, and publication bias was evaluated by a funnel plot and Egger's linear regression analysis. Our search resulted in 180 articles; we analyzed 26 studies, which included 2160 participants. The meta-analysis showed an overall beneficial effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on depression symptoms (SMD\\u2009=\\u2009-0.28, P\\u2009=\\u20090.004). Compared with placebo, EPA-pure (=100% EPA) and EPA-major formulations (≥60% EPA) demonstrated clinical benefits with an EPA dosage ≤1\\u2009g/d (SMD\\u2009=\\u2009-0.50, P\\u2009=\\u20090.003, and SMD\\u2009=\\u2009-1.03, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03, respectively), whereas DHA-pure and DHA-major formulations did not exhibit such benefits.Current evidence supports the finding that omega-3 PUFAs with EPA\\u2009≥\\u200960% at a dosage of ≤1\\u2009g/d would have beneficial effects on depression. Further studies are warranted to examine supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs for specific subgroups of subjects with inflammation, severity of depression, and the dose response for both EPA and DHA supplementation.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Depression and fatigue are conditions responsible for heavy global societal burden, especially in patients already suffering from chronic diseases. These symptoms have been identified by those affected as some of the most disabling symptoms which affect the quality of life and productivity of the individual. While many factors play a role in the development of depression and fatigue, both have been associated with increased inflammatory activation of the immune system affecting both the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). This is further supported by the well-described association between diseases that involve immune activation and these symptoms in autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and immune system activation in response to infections, like sepsis. Treatments for depression also support this immunopsychiatric link. Antidepressants have been shown to decrease inflammation, while higher levels of baseline inflammation predict lower treatment efficacy for most treatments. Those patients with higher initial immune activation may on the other hand be more responsive to treatments targeting immune pathways, which have been found to be effective in treating depression and fatigue in some cases. These results show strong support for the hypothesis that depression and fatigue are associated with an increased activation of the immune system which may serve as a valid target for treatment. Further studies should focus on the pathways involved in these symptoms and the development of treatments that target those pathways will help us to better understand these conditions and devise more targeted treatments.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders is complex, involving multiple factors that can affect the type and severity of symptoms. Although precise causes are far from being identified, allergy or other forms of hypersensitivity to dietary ingredients have been implicated in triggering or worsening of behavioral and emotional symptoms, especially in patients suffering from depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity, and/or autism. Among such ingredients, cow's milk, along with wheat gluten, is commonly suspected. However, the contributory role of cow's milk in these disorders has not been elucidated due to insufficient pathophysiological evidence. In the present study, we therefore investigated neuroinflammatory changes that are associated with behavioral abnormality using a non-anaphylactic mouse model of cow's milk allergy (CMA). Male and female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a 5-week oral sensitization procedure without or with a major milk allergen, beta-lactoglobulin (BLG). All mice were then later challenged with BLG, and their anxiety- and depression-associated behaviors were subsequently assessed during the 6th and 7th weeks. We found that BLG-sensitized male mice exhibited significantly increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior, although they did not display anaphylactic reactions when challenged with BLG. Female behavior was not noticeably affected by BLG sensitization. Upon examination of the small intestines, reduced immunoreactivity to occludin was detected in the ileal mucosa of BLG-sensitized mice although the transcriptional expression of this tight-junction protein was not significantly altered when measured by quantitative RT-PCR. On the other hand, the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in the ileal mucosa was significantly elevated in BLG-sensitized mice, suggesting the sensitization had resulted in intestinal inflammation. Inflammatory responses were also detected in the brain of BLG-sensitized mice, determined by the hypertrophic morphology of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes. These reactive astrocytes were particularly evident near the blood vessels in the midbrain region, resembling the perivascular barrier previously reported by others in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mouse models. Interestingly, increased levels of COX-2 and TNFα were also found in this region. Taken together, our results demonstrated that BLG sensitization elicits inflammatory responses in the intestine and brain without overt anaphylactic signs of milk allergy, signifying food allergy as a potential pathogenic factor of neuropsychiatric disorders.\"]},\n",

Although targeting the biogenic amines including serotonin, and norepinephrine have provided invaluable links with the pharmacological treatment of MDD over the last four decades, a growing body of evidence suggest that other biologic systems could contribute to the pathophysiology and treatment of MDD. In this chapter, we highlight the potential role of nitric oxide (NO) signaling in the pathophysiology and thereby treatment of MDD. This has been investigated over the last four decades by showing that (i) levels of NO are altered in patients with major depression; (ii) modulators of NO signaling exert antidepressant effects in patients with MDD or in the animal studies; (iii) NO signaling could be targeted by a variety of antidepressants in animal models of depression; and (iv) NO signaling can potentially modulate the inflammatory pathways that underlie the pathophysiology of MDD. These findings, which hypothesize an NO involvement in MDD, can provide a new insight into novel therapeutic approaches for patients with MDD in the future.']},\n",

In order to obtain better antidepressant effects, it is necessary to explore the efficacy of combination therapy with ketamine and other antidepressants. DHA is an unsaturated fatty acid with excellent application prospects due to its safety and antidepressant effects. This study was designed to investigate the effect of ketamine combined with DHA on lipopolysaccharide-induced depression-like behavior. In behavioral experiments, lipopolysaccharide prolongs the immobility time of the forced swimming and tail suspension tests in rats and reduces the sucrose preference. The combination of ketamine and DHA can reverse these changes and work better than the single application. Nissl staining showed that ketamine combined with DHA can reverse the nerve damage caused by lipopolysaccharide. Cell morphology observation the combination of ketamine and DHA group was more complete than that of LPS group. The combination of ketamine and DHA significantly decreased the levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-ɑin hippocampus and PC12 cells and increased the content of BDNF. Immunofluorescence results showed that ketamine combined with DHA can effectively inhibit PP65 nuclear translocation. Western blot results showed that ketamine combined with DHA can effectively inhibit the expression of NF-KB in hippocampus and PC12 cells, and increase the expression of P-CREB and BDNF. In summary, the combination of ketamine with DHA may be a more effective treatment for depression caused by inflammation and is mediated by inhibition of the inflammatory pathway.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Autotaxin (ATX) is a soluble extracellular enzyme that is abundant in mammalian plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It has two known enzymatic activities, acting as both a phosphodiesterase and a phospholipase. The majority of its biological effects have been associated with its ability to liberate lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from its substrate, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). LPA has diverse pleiotropic effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues via the activation of a family of six cognate G protein-coupled receptors. These LPA receptors (LPARs) are expressed in some combination in all known cell types in the CNS where they mediate such fundamental cellular processes as proliferation, differentiation, migration, chronic inflammation, and cytoskeletal organization. As a result, dysregulation of LPA content may contribute to many CNS and PNS disorders such as chronic inflammatory or neuropathic pain, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, metabolic syndrome-induced brain damage, traumatic brain injury, hepatic encephalopathy-induced cerebral edema, macular edema, major depressive disorder, stress-induced psychiatric disorder, alcohol-induced brain damage, HIV-induced brain injury, pruritus, and peripheral nerve injury. ATX activity is now known to be the primary biological source of this bioactive signaling lipid, and as such, represents a potentially high-value drug target. There is currently one ATX inhibitor entering phase III clinical trials, with several additional preclinical compounds under investigation. This review discusses the physiological and pathological significance of the ATX-LPA-LPA receptor signaling axis and summarizes the evidence for targeting this pathway for the treatment of CNS diseases.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Social Signal Transduction Theory of Depression is a biologically plausible, multi-level theory that describes neural, physiologic, molecular, and genomic mechanisms that link experiences of social-environmental adversity with internal biological processes that drive depression pathogenesis, maintenance, and recurrence. Central to this theory is the hypothesis that interpersonal stressors involving social threat (e.g., social conflict, evaluation, rejection, isolation, and exclusion) upregulate inflammatory processes that can induce several depressive symptoms, including sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and social-behavioral withdrawal. The original article describing this formulation (Psychol Bull 140:774-815, 2014) addressed critical questions involving depression onset and recurrence, as well as why depression is strongly predicted by early life stress and comorbid with anxiety disorders and certain physical disease conditions, such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, and cardiovascular disease. Here, we extend the theory to help explain sex differences in depression prevalence, which is a defining feature of this disorder. Central to this extension is research demonstrating that ovarian hormone fluctuations modulate women's susceptibility to stress, brain structure and function, and inflammatory activity and reactivity. These effects are evident at multiple levels and are highly context-dependent, varying as a function of several factors including sex, age, reproductive state, endogenous versus exogenous hormones, and hormone administration mode and dose. Together, these effects help explain why women are at greater risk for developing inflammation-related depressed mood and other neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders during the reproductive years, especially for those already at heightened risk for depression or in the midst of a hormonal transition period.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Research in the past decade has shown that variations in the gut microbiome may influence behavior, and vice versa. As such, interest in the role of the gut microbiome in psychiatric conditions has drawn immense interest. This is evidenced by the recent surge in published studies examining microbial dysbiosis in clinical psychiatric populations, particularly autism spectrum disorder and depression. However, critical examination of these studies reveals methodological flaws in design and execution, suggesting that they may not be held to the same standards as other bodies of clinical research. Given the complex nature of the gut microbiome, this narrative review attempts to clarify concepts critical to effectively examine its potential role in psychopathology to appropriately inform mental health researchers. More specifically, the numerous variables known to affect the gut microbiome are discussed, including inflammation, diet, weight, and medications. A comprehensive review of the extant microbiome literature in clinical psychiatric populations is also provided, in addition to clinical implications and suggestions for future directions of research. Although there is a clear need for additional studies to elucidate the gut microbiome's role in psychiatric disorders, there is an even greater need for well-designed, appropriately controlled studies to truly impact the field.\"]},\n",

Control rats received only saline without CMS exposure, whereas CMS model rats were induced to several stress (CMS) for 6\\xa0weeks. Treatment group rats were induced with CMS for 6\\xa0weeks but received either 20 or 40\\xa0mg/kg of SB or 20\\xa0mg/kg imipramine (CMS+IMP) from the 4th week to 6th week. Treatment with SB or IMP significantly ameliorated body weight, sucrose consumption rate with shorter immobility time than the control group. Also, administration with SB or IMP could reverse the hyperactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as well as decreased inflammatory cytokines with improved antioxidant status. Furthermore, the protein expression of NLRP3 (inflammasome) was markedly downregulated upon treatment with SB (both 20 and 40\\xa0mg) or IMP and thereby confirming its potent anti-depressant activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Salvianolic acid B (SB) is a phenolic acid extracted from Salvia militiorrhiza Bunge, a popular Chinese herb, which has been prescribed for various pathological conditions. SB has been previously reported with anti-depressant activity but, the in-depth mechanism behind the anti-depressant effect of SB against CMS is still elusive. Hence, the current study was plotted to explore the in-depth mechanism behind the anti-depressant effect of SB against CMS model of depression in rats. The outcome of the current study has confirmed the anti-depressant activity by abolishing oxidative stress, and neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Hence, SB can be prescribed to major depression patients with standard anti-depressant agents to abolish oxidative stress, neuro-inflammatory response, and related neurological changes.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Major psychiatric disorders are linked to early mortality and patients afflicted with these ailments demonstrate an increased risk of developing physical diseases that are characteristically seen in the elderly. Psychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia may be associated with accelerated cellular aging, indicated by shortened leukocyte telomere length (LTL), which could underlie this connection. Telomere shortening occurs with repeated cell division and is reflective of a cell's mitotic history. It is also influenced by cumulative exposure to inflammation and oxidative stress as well as the availability of telomerase, the telomere-lengthening enzyme. Precariously short telomeres can cause cells to undergo senescence, apoptosis or genomic instability; shorter LTL correlates with compromised general health and foretells mortality. Important data specify that LTL may be reduced in principal psychiatric illnesses, possibly in proportion to exposure to the ailment. Telomerase, as measured in peripheral blood monocytes, has been less well characterized in psychiatric illnesses, but a role in mood disorder has been suggested by preclinical and clinical studies. In this manuscript, the most recent studies on LTL and telomerase activity in mood disorders are comprehensively reviewed, potential mediators are discussed, and future directions are suggested. An enhanced comprehension of cellular aging in psychiatric illnesses could lead to their re-conceptualizing as systemic ailments with manifestations both inside and outside the brain. At the same time this paradigm shift could identify new treatment targets, helpful in bringing about lasting cures to innumerable sufferers across the globe.\"]},\n",

This study aimed to investigate the molecular inflammatory signaling pathways associated with cerebellar fastigial nucleus stimulation in an established rat model of post-stroke depression. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats included a sham group (N=6), an untreated stroke group (N=6), an untreated post-stroke depression model group (PSD) (N=6), and the model group treated with cerebellar fastigial nucleus stimulation (FNS) (N=6). The rat stroke model involved occlusion of the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Post-stroke depression model was established using chronic unpredictable mild stress treatment and was verified using an open field test. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot compared expression levels of microRNA-29c (miR-29c), miR-676, TNFRSF1A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1ß in cerebellar tissue. U251 human glioblastoma cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were studied in vitro. RESULTS Cerebellar fastigial nucleus stimulation reduced behaviors associated with depression in the rat model, upregulated the expression of miR-29c, and reduced the expression of TNFRSF1A and inflammatory cytokines, and mildly reduced neuronal apoptosis. Bioinformatics data analysis identified a regulatory relationship between miR-29c and TNFRSF1A. SH-SY5Y cells treated with a miR-29c mimic, or TNFRSF1A short interfering RNA (siRNA), identified a negative regulatory relationship between TNFRSF1A and miR-29c. CONCLUSIONS In a rat model, cerebellar fastigial nucleus stimulation reduced the expression of TNFRSF1A by upregulating miR-29c expression, which suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in reduced severity of post-stroke depression.']},\n",

We hypothesized that inhibition of neuroinflammation by the PIC synthesis inhibitor, pentoxifylline (PTX) would prevent depression-like behaviors induced by heart failure (HF) post-MI in OVX female rats. PTX treatment was initiated in female Wistar rats, 1 week after ovariectomy, and 1 week before MI by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. Eight weeks post-MI, OVX female rats treated with vehicle or PTX exhibited a similar MI size and degree of cardiac dysfunction. OVX female rats post-MI developed depression-like behaviors consisting of anhedonia, despair behavior and enhanced freezing behavior in the cued conditioning test. PTX prevented the depression-like behavior symptoms and enhanced freezing. Cytokine levels were elevated in plasma and both paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and PFC, and the mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) was decreased in the PFC of OVX female rats post-MI. PTX treatment limited the decrease of mBDNF, and decreased cytokine levels in plasma, PVN and PFC to (below) sham levels. These findings show that OVX female rats post-MI exhibit an increase in both peripheral and central inflammation. PTX treatment prevents increases in PIC levels in plasma and PVN but does not attenuate the progression of cardiac dysfunction. In contrast, PTX prevents enhanced PIC production in the PFC, as well as limits depression-like behaviors induced by MI in OVX female rats.']},\n",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of inflammation in the development of depression in CHD patients during a 3-year follow-up. We examined the inflammatory biomarker, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), measured at baseline, as a potential predictor of later onset of depression. We recruited 89 CHD patients, who were assessed at baseline and then every 6\\u202fmonths, for three years. The sample included, at baseline, 25 depressed and 64 non-depressed CHD patients, as confirmed by Clinical Interview Schedule Revised (CIS-R). Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and all follow-up points by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). In all CHD patients (n\\u202f=\\u202f89), we found a significant positive correlation between hsCRP levels and the severity of depressive symptoms at baseline (PHQ-9, r\\u202f=\\u202f0.23, p\\u202f=\\u202f0.032). During follow-up, n\\u202f=\\u202f21 patients (of the 64 non-depressed at baseline) developed depression, defined as being PHQ-9 positive (a score\\u202f≥\\u202f10) in at least one follow-up assessment. Of these, n\\u202f=\\u202f9 subjects were defined as developing clinically-significant depression, that is, having a positive PHQ-9 in at least 3 of the 6 follow-up assessments, implying a duration of symptoms of at least one year. We found that increased hsCRP values at baseline predicted future onset of depression. Specifically, baseline hsCRP values were higher in patients who later developed clinically-significant depression (mean\\u202f±\\u202fSD; 6.76\\u202f±\\u202f6.52\\u202fmg/L) compared with never-depressed (2.77\\u202f±\\u202f3.13\\u202fmg/L; F(1,48)\\u202f=\\u202f7.29, p\\u202f=\\u202f0.010), even after controlling for baseline PHQ-9 scores. In conclusion, inflammation in CHD patients is associated with future development of clinically-significant depression. HsCRP, a reliable and ready-to-use biological marker of inflammation, may help to identify depression high-risk phenotypes even among CHD patients, who already have high baseline inflammation. Our study conveys important preliminary findings that will require further replication but that have the potential to affect the mental and physical health of a vulnerable group of individuals.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Inflammation has been implicated in depressive symptoms, but few studies use longitudinal designs with adolescents. Furthermore, the extant literature has yielded inconsistent results. Blood was collected from a community sample of 201 adolescents (109 female, ages 12.3-20.0) and analyzed for inflammatory proteins. Up to five follow-up assessments of depressive symptoms were conducted. Multi-level modeling indicated that high C-reactive protein (CRP) (but no other proinflammatory markers) predicted depressive symptom increases. Three-way interactions between different inflammatory biomarkers, sex, and months-to-follow-up predicted change in depressive symptoms. Higher interleukin-6 predicted increased depressive symptoms at 13-31 months after baseline assessment of depression and inflammation for females. Higher tumor necrosis factor-alpha predicted increased depressive symptoms at < 1 month after baseline for males and 13-31 months after baseline for females. Higher interleukin-8 in males predicted lower depressive symptoms at 31 months after baseline. Exploratory post-hoc analyses examined these predictive associations for specific subsets of depressive symptoms. These findings are the first to support the predictive association of elevated CRP for depressive symptoms in a community adolescent sample and serve as preliminary evidence that the relationship between cytokines and later depressive symptoms differs by sex, time-to-follow-up, and the specific biomarker.']},\n",

Finally, RT-PCR and lncRNA-mRNA regulatory network was performed to verify the expressions of lncRNAs and mRNAs related to the occurrence and development of DD. 28 lncRNAs, 107 circRNAs, and 89 mRNAs were identified in DD differential expression profiles. GO and pathway analysis found that 20 biological process (BP) related entities and 20 pathways associated with DD. The analysis shows that the genes that are differentially expressed in the DD group involved in the development of the neuropsychiatric system, immunity, and inflammation. Then, we screening for the important DElncRNA and mRNA associated with DD were verified by RT-PCR experiments and the results of RT-PCR were consistent with the sequencing results.

       "  'abstract': ['Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in the world. Andrographolide is a natural product that displays evident anti-inflammatory activities. The purpose of the present study was to explore the antidepressant potential of andrographolide in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Performance in behavioral tests such as the forced swim test, sucrose preference test, tail suspension test and Y-maze was improved following andrographolide administration. The pro-inflammatory mediator NO and cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 as well as TNF-α were measured in the prefrontal cortex using a reagent kit, ELISA and real-time PCR. NF-κB signaling, NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and autophagy process were examined in the prefrontal cortex using western blotting. It was observed that 5\\u202fmg/kg andrographolide treatment obviously improved depressive-like behavior. In addition, 5\\u202fmg/kg andrographolide treatment also decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines (NO, COX-2, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α), NF-κB signaling (p-p65, p-IκBα) and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly (NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1) in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, autophagy levels increased after andrographolide treatment. Finally, the antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects of andrographolide were compromised by the application of chloroquine (CQ), which suggested that andrographolide-induced autophagy was mainly affected by the initiation rather than the blocking of autophagic flux. In conclusion, these results suggest that andrographolide produces antidepressant-like and anti-inflammatory effects in CUMS-induced mice which maybe mediated by the upregulation of autophagy.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Prolonged exposure to bullying behaviors may give rise to symptoms such as anxiety, depression and chronic pain. Earlier data suggest that these symptoms often are associated with stress-induced low-grade systemic inflammation. Here, using data from both animals and humans, we examined the moderating role of microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) in this process. In the present study, a resident-intruder paradigm, blood samples, tissue harvesting and subsequent qPCR analyses were used to screen for stress-induced changes in circulating miRNAs in rats. The negative acts questionnaire (NAQ), TaqMan assays and a numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain intensity were then used to examine the associations among bullying behaviors, relevant miRNA polymorphisms and pain in a probability sample of 996 Norwegian employees. In rats, inhibited weight gain, reduced pituitary POMC expression, adrenal Nr3c1 mRNA downregulation, as well as increased miR-146a, miR-30c and miR-223 in plasma were observed following 1 week of repeated exposure to social stress. When following up the miRNA findings from the animal study in the human working population, a stronger relationship between NAQ and NRS scores was observed in subjects with the miR-30c GG genotype (rs928508) compared to other subjects. A stronger relationship between NAQ and NRS scores was also seen in men with the miR-223\\u2009G genotype (rs3848900) as compared to other men. Our findings show that social stress may induce many physiological changes including changed expression of miRNAs. We conclude that the miR-30c GG genotype in men and women, and the miR-223\\u2009G genotype in men, amplify the association between exposure to bullying behaviors and pain.Lay summaryUsing an animal model of social stress, we identified miR-146a, miR-30c and miR-223 as potentially important gene regulatory molecules that may be involved in the stress response. Interestingly, human genotypes affecting the expression of mature miR-30c and miR-223 had a moderating effect on the association between exposure to bullying and pain. Subjects with the miR-30c rs928508 GG genotype had a significantly stronger association between exposure to bullying behaviors and pain than other subjects. The same was observed in men with the miR-223 rs3848900\\u2009G genotype, as compared to other men.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Caspases are a family of conserved cysteine proteases that play key roles in multiple cellular processes, including programmed cell death and inflammation. Recent evidence shows that caspases are also involved in crucial non-apoptotic functions, such as dendrite development, axon pruning, and synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying learning and memory processes. The activated form of caspase-3, which is known to trigger widespread damage and degeneration, can also modulate synaptic function in the adult brain. Thus, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that caspase-3 modulates synaptic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) induced kinase 1 (PINK1) mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Loss of PINK1 has been previously associated with an impairment of corticostriatal long-term depression (LTD), rescued by amphetamine-induced dopamine release. Here, we show that caspase-3 activity, measured after LTD induction, is significantly decreased in the PINK1 knockout model compared with wild-type mice. Accordingly, pretreatment of striatal slices with the caspase-3 activator α-(Trichloromethyl)-4-pyridineethanol (PETCM) rescues a physiological LTD in PINK1 knockout mice. Furthermore, the inhibition of caspase-3 prevents the amphetamine-induced rescue of LTD in the same model. Our data support a hormesis-based double role of caspase-3; when massively activated, it induces apoptosis, while at lower level of activation, it modulates physiological phenomena, like the expression of corticostriatal LTD. Exploring the non-apoptotic activation of caspase-3 may contribute to clarify the mechanisms involved in synaptic failure in PD, as well as in view of new potential pharmacological targets.\"]},\n",

It has recently been shown that changes in A-to-I RNA editing rates are associated with various pathologies such as inflammatory disorders, depression and suicide. Interestingly, IFN-α induces gene expression of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1-1 (ADAR1a-p150) and alters overall RNA editing activity. In this study, we took advantage of the high prevalence of pharmacologically induced depression in patients treated with IFN-α and ribavirin to test the interest of RNA editing-related biomarkers in white blood cells of patients. In this 16-week longitudinal study, a small cohort of patients was clinically evaluated using standard assessment methods prior to and during antiviral therapy and blood samples were collected to analyse RNA editing modifications. A-I RNA editing activity on the phosphodiesterase 8A (PDE8A) gene, a previously identified RNA editing hotspot in the context of lupus erythematosus, was quantified by using an ultra-deep next-generation sequencing approach. We also monitored gene expression levels of the ADAR enzymes and the PDE8A gene during treatment by qPCR. As expected, psychiatric evaluation could track treatment-emergent depression, which occurred in 30% of HCV patients. We show that PDE8A RNA editing is increased in all patients following interferon treatment, but differently in 30% of patients. This effect was mimicked in a cellular model using SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells. By combining the data of A-I\\xa0RNA editing and gene expression, we generated an algorithm that allowed discrimination between the group of patients who developed a treatment-emergent depression and those who did not. The current model of drug-induced depression identified A-I\\xa0RNA editing biomarkers as useful tools for the identification of individuals at risk of developing depression in an objective, quantifiable biological blood test.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Septic shock with heart dysfunction is common in intensive care units. However, the mechanism underlying myocardial depression is still unclear. Whether circular RNA (circRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) profiles differ between patients with and without myocardial depression is unknown. We generated a hypodynamic septic shock model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in adolescent rats. A total of 12 rats were utilized and heart tissue from each was collected. RNA sequencing was performed on left ventricular tissue. We focused on features of circRNAs and miRNAs, predicting their function by bioinformatic analysis and constructing circRNA-associated and miRNA-associated regulatory networks in heart tissue. We detected 851 circRNAs in heart samples, and 11 showed differential expression. A total of 639 annotated miRNAs and 91 novel miRNAs were explored including 78 showing differential expression between the two groups. We then constructed the most comprehensive circRNA-associated and miRNA-associated networks to explore their regulatory relationship in septic heart tissue, and demonstrated that different networks could potentially participate in and regulate the pathological process of sepsis. Furthermore, gene ontology term enrichment indicated miRNAs, and miRNA-mRNA networks could be associated with regulation and metabolic process, or influence cellular functions. The construction of regulator networks could improve the understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial depression. It will be important for future investigations to ascertain the biological mechanisms present during the development of sepsis-induced myocardial depression to influence approaches to treatment.']},\n",

Although the general roles of several signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders have so far been identified, the exact pathophysiology of neuronal disorders and their effective treatments have not yet been precisely elucidated. This requires multi-target treatments, which should simultaneously attenuate neuronal inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. In this regard, astaxanthin (AST) has gained growing interest as a multi-target pharmacological agent against neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain and spinal cord injuries, neuropathic pain (NP), aging, depression, and autism. The present review highlights the neuroprotective effects of AST mainly based on its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-apoptotic properties that underlies its pharmacological mechanisms of action to tackle neurodegeneration. The need to develop novel AST delivery systems, including nanoformulations, targeted therapy, and beyond, is also considered.\"]},\n",

Outcomes were differences in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), Visual Analog Scale Fatigue (VAS fatigue), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Analysis of metabolomics was also performed. The subscales \"physical fatigue\" and \"mental fatigue\" in MFI-20 and symptoms of depression using HADS depression scale improved significantly at week 20 in the exercise group compared with the control group. Exercise did not influence global fatigue rated by VAS or subscales \"reduced motivation\", \"reduced activity\" and \"general fatigue\" in MFI-20. No significant change was found on the anxiety index of HADS. The improvements in physical fatigue were associated with changes in the metabolism of lipids, bile acids, the urea cycle and several sugars.

Adults (n\\u202f=\\u202f115) were randomized to receive endotoxin or placebo.

As a novel class of probiotics, the application of psychobiotics has led researchers to focus on a new area in neuroscience.

Psychobiotics are efficacious in improving neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Use of psychobiotics can improve GI function, ASD symptoms, motor functions of patients with PD and cognition in patients with AD.

By conventional echocardiographic parameters, biventricular systolic dysfunction is more prevalent in children with septic shock, though strain imaging reveals that myocardial injury may be more common in adults than previously thought. In contrast, diastolic dysfunction in general and post-arrest myocardial systolic dysfunction appear to be more widespread in the adult population. A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction mediates myocardial depression in critical illness; alterations in mitochondrial electron transport system function, bioenergetic production, oxidative and nitrosative stress, uncoupling, mitochondrial permeability transition, fusion, fission, biogenesis, and autophagy all may play key pathophysiologic roles. In this review we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical phenotypes of myocardial dysfunction in septic shock and post-cardiac arrest and the multifaceted manifestations of mitochondrial injury in these disease processes. Since neonatal and pediatric-specific data for mitochondrial dysfunction remain sparse, conclusive age-dependent differences are not clear; instead, we highlight what evidence exists and identify gaps in knowledge to guide future research. Finally, since focal ischemic injury (with or without reperfusion) leading to myocardial infarction is predominantly an atherosclerotic disease of the elderly, this review focuses specifically on septic shock and global ischemia-reperfusion injury occurring after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Increased peripheral levels of cytokines and central microglial activation have been reported in patients with psychiatric disorders. The degree of both innate and adaptive immune activation is also associated with worse clinical outcomes and poor treatment response in these patients. Understanding the possible causes and mechanisms leading to this immune activation is therefore an important and necessary step for the development of novel and more effective treatment strategies for these patients. In this work, we review the evidence of literature pointing to childhood trauma as one of the main causes behind the increased immune activation in patients with psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the potential mechanisms linking the experience of early life adversity (ELA) to innate immune activation. Specifically, we focus on the innervation of the bone marrow from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as a new and emerging mechanism that has the potential to bridge the observed increases in both central and peripheral inflammatory markers in patients exposed to ELA. Experimental studies in laboratory rodents suggest that SNS activation following early life stress exposure causes a shift in the profile of innate immune cells, with an increase in proinflammatory monocytes. In turn, these cells traffic to the brain and influence neural circuitry, which manifests as increased anxiety and other relevant behavioural phenotypes. To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to explore this candidate mechanism in humans. Future research is also needed to clarify whether these pathways could be partially reversible to improve prevention and treatment strategies in the future.']},\n",

Of increasing prevalence in Western societies, these conditions carry a high burden of care. Dietary patterns and environmental factors have a profound effect on shaping gut microbiota in real time. Diverse populations of intestinal bacteria mediate their beneficial effects through the fermentation of dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids, endogenous signals with important roles in lipid homeostasis and reducing inflammation. Recent progress shows that an individual's starting microbial profile is a key determinant in predicting their response to intervention with live probiotics. The gut microbiota is complex and challenging to characterize.

       "  'abstract': ['Several epidemiological studies have clearly shown the high co-morbidity between depression and Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). Different studies have been conducted to identify the common pathophysiological events of these diseases such as the overactivation of the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis and, most importantly, the dysregulation of immune system which causes a chronic pro-inflammatory status. The biological link between depression, inflammation, and CVD can be related to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, released by macrophages which play a central role in the pathophysiology of both depression and CVD. Pro-inflammatory cytokines interfere with many of the pathophysiological mechanisms relevant to depression by upregulating the rate-limiting enzymes in the metabolic pathway of tryptophan and altering serotonin metabolism. These cytokines also increase the risk to develop CVD, because activation of macrophages under this pro-inflammatory status is closely associated with endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, a preamble to atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is an endogenous dipeptide which exerts a strong antiinflammatory activity on macrophages by suppressing reactive species and pro-inflammatory cytokines production and altering pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. This dipeptide exhibits antioxidant properties scavenging reactive species and preventing oxidative stress-induced pathologies such as CVD. In the present review we will discuss the role of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation as common pathophysiological events both in depression and CVD and the preclinical and clinical evidence on the protective effect of carnosine in both diseases as well as the therapeutic potential of this dipeptide in depressed patients with a high co-morbidity of cardiovascular diseases.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Transposable elements (TEs) are highly repetitive DNA sequences in the human genome that are the relics of previous retrotransposition events. Although the majority of TEs are transcriptionally inactive due to acquired mutations or epigenetic processes, around 8% of TEs exert transcriptional activity. It has been found that TEs contribute to somatic mosaicism that accounts for functional specification of various brain cells. Indeed, autonomous retrotransposition of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) sequences has been reported in the neural rat progenitor cells from the hippocampus, the human fetal brain and the human embryonic stem cells. Moreover, expression of TEs has been found to regulate immune-inflammatory responses, conditioning immunity against exogenous infections. Therefore, aberrant epigenetic regulation and expression of TEs emerged as a potential mechanism underlying the development of various mental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, some studies revealed that expression of some sequences of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) appears only in a certain group of patients with mental disorders (especially those with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ASD) but not in healthy controls. In addition, it has been found that expression of HERVs might be related to subclinical inflammation observed in mental disorders. In this article, we provide an overview of detrimental effects of transposition on the brain development and immune mechanisms with relevance to mental disorders. We show that transposition is not the only mechanism, explaining the way TEs might shape the phenotype of mental disorders. Other mechanisms include the regulation of gene expression and the impact on genomic stability. Next, we review current evidence from studies investigating expression and epigenetic regulation of specific TEs in various mental disorders. Most consistently, these studies indicate altered expression of HERVs and methylation of LINE-1 sequences in patients with ASD, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. However, the contribution of TEs to the etiology of AD is poorly documented. Future studies should further investigate the mechanisms linking epigenetic processes, specific TEs and the phenotype of mental disorders to disentangle causal associations.\"]},\n",

Anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used as adjuvant treatments for MDD. However, no studies examined the effects of a combinatorial treatment with sertraline and ketoprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, on Ca and Mg levels in MDD. The present study examined a) differences in both cations between drug-naïve MDD patients and controls, and b) the effects of sertraline and ketoprofen on Ca and Mg (both total and ionized). In the same patients, we also examined the associations between both cations and IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-18, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, zinc, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Clinical improvement was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at baseline and after follow up for 2 months. Serum Ca and Mg (total and ionized) were significantly lower in MDD patients as compared with controls, while treatment significantly increased calcium but decreased magnesium levels. There were significant and inverse correlations between the BDI-II scores from baseline to endpoint and Ca (both total and ionized), but not Mg, levels. The effects of calcium on the BDI-II score remained significant after considering the effects of zinc, IDO and an immune activation z unit-weighted composite score based on the sum of all cytokines. There was a significant and inverse association between this immune activation index and calcium levels from baseline to endpoint. In conclusion, lowered levels of both cations play a role in the pathophysiology of major depression. Antidepressant-induced increases in Ca are associated with clinical efficacy and attenuation of the immune response. The suppressant effect of antidepressants on Mg levels is probably a side effect of those drugs. New antidepressant treatments should be developed that increase the levels both Ca and Mg.

       "  'abstract': ['Background and aims Chronic low back pain (chronic LBP) is the number one cause for years lived with disability among 301 diseases and injuries analyzed by The Global Burden of Disease study 2013. Insomnia is highly prevalent among people with chronic LBP. To explain the sleep-pain relationship, theoretical models propose that insomnia symptoms may be associated with increased basal inflammation, operationalized as c-reactive protein (CRP) and lead to further pain and disrupted sleep. We aimed to determine the associations between insomnia, chronic LBP, and inflammation (operationalized as CRP), whilst controlling for age, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, depression, anxiety and osteoarthritis. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of the third Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (2006-2008), a rural population survey of 50,666 participants in Norway aged 20-96 years. Insomnia (dichotomous) was defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition, and chronic LBP (dichotomous) as low back pain or stiffness lasting at least 3 months. Data for CRP were obtained from non-fasting serum samples and assessed via latex immunoassay methodology. We excluded participants with the following self-reported chronic somatic diseases: chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia or ankylosing spondylosis. Possible associations between presence of insomnia and presence of chronic LBP (dependent), and the level of CRP and presence of chronic LBP (dependent), were assessed using logistic regression models. The possible association between insomnia and CRP (dependent) was assessed using linear regression. Multivariable analyses were conducted adjusting for confounders stated in our aim that achieved p\\u2009≤\\u20090.2 in univariate regressions. We performed stratified analyses for participants with \"Normal\" (<3 mg/L) \"Elevated\" (3-10 mg/L) and \"Very High\" (>10 mg/L) levels of CRP. Results In our total included sample (n\\u2009=\\u200930,669, median age 52.6, 54% female), 6.1% had insomnia (n\\u2009=\\u20091,871), 21.4% had chronic LBP (n\\u2009=\\u20096,559), and 2.4% had both (n\\u2009=\\u2009719). Twenty four thousand two hundred eighty-eight (79%) participants had \"Normal\" CRP, 5,275 (17%) had \"Elevated\" CRP, and 1,136 (4%) had \"Very High\" CRP. For participants with \"Normal\" levels of CRP, insomnia was associated with higher levels of CRP (adjusted B\\u2009=\\u20090.04, 95%CI [0.00-0.08], p\\u2009=\\u20090.046), but not for people with \"Elevated\" or \"Very High\" levels of CRP. There was an association between CRP and presence of chronic LBP in the total sample (adjusted OR\\u2009=\\u20091.01, [1.00-1.01], p\\u2009=\\u20090.013) and for people with \"Normal\" CRP (1.05, [1.00-1.10, p\\u2009=\\u20090.034]. Insomnia was associated with the presence of chronic LBP in the total sample (adjusted OR\\u2009=\\u20091.99, 95%CI [1.79-2.21], <0.001) and for people with \"Normal\", \"Elevated\" and \"Very High\". Conclusions Individuals with insomnia have twice the odds of reporting chronic LBP. Insomnia, CRP and chronic LBP appear to be linked but the role of CRP appears to be limited. Longitudinal studies may help further explore the causal inference between insomnia chronic LBP, and inflammation. Implications Given the strong relationship between insomnia and chronic LBP, screening and management of comorbid insomnia and chronic LBP should be considered in clinical practice. Further longitudinal studies are required to explore whether the presence of insomnia and increased inflammation affects the development of chronic LBP.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Acne is a highly prevalent inflammatory skin condition involving sebaceous sties. Although it clearly develops from an interplay of multiple factors, the exact cause of acne remains elusive. It is increasingly believed that the interaction between skin microbes and host immunity plays an important role in this disease, with perturbed microbial composition and activity found in acne patients. Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes; formerly called Propionibacterium acnes) is commonly found in sebum-rich areas and its over-proliferation has long been thought to contribute to the disease. However, information provided by advanced metagenomic sequencing has indicated that the cutaneous microbiota in acne patients and acne-free individuals differ at the virulent-specific lineage level. Acne also has close connections with the gastrointestinal tract, and many argue that the gut microbiota could be involved in the pathogenic process of acne. The emotions of stress (e.g., depression and anxiety), for instance, have been hypothesized to aggravate acne by altering the gut microbiota and increasing intestinal permeability, potentially contributing to skin inflammation. Over the years, an expanding body of research has highlighted the presence of a gut-brain-skin axis that connects gut microbes, oral probiotics, and diet, currently an area of intense scrutiny, to acne severity. This review concentrates on the skin and gut microbes in acne, the role that the gut-brain-skin axis plays in the immunobiology of acne, and newly emerging microbiome-based therapies that can be applied to treat acne.']},\n",

Experimental data in animals and observational data in humans revealed evidence for biological alterations in response to CT that may contribute to its long-term consequences. This includes epigenetic changes in miRNA levels that contribute to complex alterations of gene expression. We investigated the association between CT and 121 miRNAs in a target sample of N\\u2009=\\u2009150 subjects from the general population and patients from the Department of Psychiatry. We hypothesized that CT exhibits a long-term effect on miRNA plasma levels. We supported our findings using bioinformatics tools and databases. Among the 121 miRNAs 22 were nominally significantly associated with CT and four of them (let-7g-5p, miR-103a-3p, miR-107, and miR-142-3p) also after correction for multiple testing; most of them were previously associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or depression. Pathway analyses of target genes identified significant pathways involved in neurodevelopment, inflammation and intracellular transduction signaling. In an independent general population sample (N\\u2009=\\u2009587) three of the four miRNAs were replicated. Extended analyses in the general population sample only (N\\u2009=\\u2009687) showed associations of the four miRNAs with gender, memory, and brain volumes. We gained increasing evidence for a link between CT, depression and AD through miRNA alterations. We hypothesize that depression and AD not only share environmental factors like CT but also biological factors like altered miRNA levels. This miRNA pattern could serve as mediating factor on the biological path from CT to adult neuropsychiatric disorders.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Stress is implicated in the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and leads to the activation of proinflammatory pathways, which are recognized to induce depressive symptoms. For instance, depression is commonly observed in patients with hepatitis C and cancer under IFN therapy, and high levels of inflammatory cytokines are described in the serum of individuals with MDD - which indicate a multi-system aspect of psychiatric disorders. Thus, we evaluated the effects of a two-hit model of depression on peripheral and CNS inflammatory, neurotrophic, and oxidative stress parameters and behavior. Male Wistar rats were submitted to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections, followed by a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) protocol. Rats exposed to CUMS (CUMS\\u2009+\\u2009groups) exhibited reduced body weight, sucrose consumption and preference as well as an increased score of coat state and locomotor behavior. Interestingly, higher IFNγ serum levels were observed in the LPS/CUMS\\u2009+\\u2009group, which were further correlated with reduced sucrose consumption. Hypertrophy of adrenal gland was also observed in CUMS+, and splenic hypertrophy was exclusive of LPS-injected animals. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were decreased in the serum of CUMS\\u2009+\\u2009animals, while no differences were found in the hippocampus and on lipid peroxidation levels. Besides corroborating the effectiveness of the CUMS model on inducing depressive-like behavior, our findings suggest that the combination of different etiological and pathophysiological components of MDD may provide with a more translational approach. Also, the correlation of increased IFNγ peripheral levels with an anhedonic-like phenotype reinforce the contemporary concept of psychiatric disorders being considered multi-system inflammatory diseases.']},\n",

These functions range from sensing internal and external threats, creating a memory of the insult and generating reflexes, which aim to resolve inflammation. Impairment in such functioning leads to chronic inflammatory diseases. By interacting through a common language of ligands and receptors, the immune and sensory nervous systems work in concert to accomplish such protective functions. Whilst this bidirectional communication helps to protect from danger, it can contribute to disease pathophysiology. Thus, the somatosensory nervous system is anatomically positioned within primary and secondary lymphoid tissues and mucosa to modulate immunity directly. Upstream of this interplay, neurons detect danger, which prompts the release of neuropeptides initiating (i) defensive reflexes (ranging from withdrawal response to coughing) and (ii) chemotaxis, adhesion and local infiltration of immune cells. The resulting outcome of such neuro-immune interplay is still ill-defined, but consensual findings start to emerge and support neuropeptides not only as blockers of T']},\n",

Previous studies showed that sulforaphane (SFN) has wide protective effects against tissue injury and inflammation. Accumulating evidence has shown that microRNAs play important roles in the development of hepatic fibrosis, some of which have been identified as potential therapeutic targets. This study was conducted to explore the role of SFN in the suppression of HSC activation. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that HSC miR-423-5p levels were up-regulated during HSC activation and down-regulated after SFN administration. Further, transfection of a miR-423-5p mimic demonstrated that inhibition of HSC activation by SFN required down-regulation of miR-423-5p. We showed that suppressor of fused is the direct target of miR-423-5p. SFN may play a role in inhibiting hepatic fibrosis by downregulating miRNA-423-5p. MiRNA-423-5p may be useful as a therapeutic target for treating hepatic fibrosis.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Burden of disease study ranks headache disorders as the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. Migraine has an estimated prevalence of 10 to 14% and is therefore the most common neurological pathology. It concerns young populations, with a female/male ratio of 3/1, and its impact in economic terms is mainly related to indirect costs. Migraine can be episodic or chronic depending on the frequency of headache days (≥\\u200915\\u2009days per month). The diagnosis of migraine is made according to international criteria, which are easy to use, with essential questions to be asked to patients in a logical order and structure. The migraine is explained by an activation of the so-called trigeminocervical system, with release of neuromediators participating in neurogenic inflammation and activation of second-order neurons. Migraine with aura is manifested by neurological symptoms, lasting less than 60\\u2009minutes, explained by the phenomenon of cortical spreading depression. Visual symptoms are the most commonly described aura event of migraine, other auras include sensory and speech disturbance. Cortical spreading depression is a slowly propagating wave of near-complete depolarization of neurons and glial cells spreading over the cortex at a speed of ∼3-5\\u2009mm/min. First-line acute treatment for migraine consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), triptans and antiemetics. Patients with frequent or chronic headaches warrant prophylactic therapy. Various classes of preventives can be used (β-blockers, tricyclics, antiepileptics), with the choice of therapy tailored to the patient's risk factors and symptoms. In practice, treatment has two axes: NSAID or triptans for crisis treatment and for background treatment prescribed case by case, the first-intention molecules according to the French recommendations are beta-blockers, then, in case of failure, topiramate, oxetorone or amitriptyline.\"]},\n",

Typical symptoms on presentation are bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, fecal urgency, and tenesmus. In some patients, extraintestinal manifestations may predate the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. A diagnosis of UC is made on the basis of presenting symptoms consistent with UC as well as endoscopic evidence showing continuous and diffuse colonic inflammation that starts in the rectum. Biopsies of the colon documenting chronic inflammation confirm the diagnosis of UC. Most cases are treated with pharmacological therapy to first induce remission and then to maintain a corticosteroid-free remission. There are multiple classes of drugs used to treat the disease. For mild to moderate UC, oral and rectal 5-aminosalycilates are typically used. In moderate to severe colitis, medication classes include thiopurines, biological agents targeting tumor necrosis factor and integrins, and the small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitors. However, in up to 15% of cases, patients in whom medical therapy fails or who have development of dysplasia secondary to their long-standing colitis will require surgical treatment. Finally, to minimize the complications of UC and adverse events from medications, a working collaboration between primary care physicians and gastroenterologists is necessary to make sure that vaccinations are optimized and that patients are screened for colon cancer, skin cancer, bone loss, depression, and other treatable and preventable complications.']},\n",

Results showed that HC1 diet remarkably decreased final weight (FW), weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), hepatic activities of total anti-oxidation capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), the AMP/ATP ratio, the p-AMPKα/t-AMPKα ratio, sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) protein expression and hepatic transcriptions of AMPKα2, SIRT1, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), catalase (CAT), manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and interleukin10 (IL 10) compared to the control group, whereas the opposite was true for protein efficiency ratio (PER), nitrogen retention efficiency (NRE), energy retention efficiency (ERE), plasma glucose levels, alanine transaminase (AST) and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) activities, hepatic contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF α) and interleukin 1β (IL 1β), ATP and AMP contents and hepatic transcriptions of kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1), IkB kinase α (IKK α), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), TNF α, IL 1β, interleukin 6 (IL 6) and transforming growth factor β (TGF β). As for the HC groups, fish fed the HC2 diet obtained relatively high values of SGR, PER, NRE, ERE, hepatic activities of T-AOC, SOD and CAT, the AMP/ATP ratio, the p-AMPKα/t-AMPKα ratio, SIRT1 protein expression and hepatic transcriptions of AMPKα2, Nrf2, CAT, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), Mn-SOD, GPx1, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and interleukin10 (IL 10), while the opposite was true for hepatic content of IL 6 and transcription of IKK α. Overall, an 80% satiation improved the growth performance and alleviated the oxidative stress and inflammation of blunt snout bream fed HC diets via the activation of the AMPK-SIRT1 pathway and the up-regulation of the activities and transcriptions of Nrf2-modulated antioxidant enzymes coupled with the depression of the levels and transcriptions of the NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the primary disease model of multiple sclerosis (MS), one of the most diffused neurological diseases characterized by fatigue, muscle weakness, vision loss, anxiety and depression. EAE can be induced through injection of myelin peptides to susceptible mouse or rat strains. In particular, EAE elicited by the autoimmune reaction against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) presents the common features of human MS: inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. Optic neuritis affects visual pathways in both MS and in several EAE models. Neurophysiological evaluation through visual evoked potential (VEP) recording is useful to check visual pathway dysfunctions and to test the efficacy of innovative treatments against optic neuritis. For this purpose, we investigate the extent of VEP abnormalities in the dark agouti (DA) rat immunized with MOG, which develops a relapsing-remitting disease course. Together with the detection of motor signs, we acquired VEPs during both early and late stages of EAE, taking advantage of a non-invasive recording procedure that allows long follow-up studies. The validation of VEP outcomes was determined by comparison with ON histopathology, aimed at revealing inflammation, demyelination and nerve fiber loss. Our results indicate that the first VEP latency delay in MOG-EAE DA rats appeared before motor deficits and were mainly related to an inflammatory state. Subsequent VEP delays, detected during relapsing EAE phases, were associated with a combination of inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. Moreover, DA rats with atypical EAE clinical course tested at extremely late time points, manifested abnormal VEPs although motor signs were mild. Overall, our data demonstrated that non-invasive VEPs are a powerful tool to detect visual involvement at different stages of EAE, prompting their validation as biomarkers to test novel treatments against MS optic neuritis.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide with global distribution of 322 million people suffering from the disease. While much is understood about depression, the underlying pathophysiology is yet to be fully characterized. Recently, the unfolded protein response (UPR) has been shown to be involved in regulating key aspects like inflammation, cell death, and behavioral depression. The UPR is an evolutionarily conserved ancient response system that reacts to the stressful environmental impact on a cell; the net effect of stress to a cell is that the quality of protein folding is diminished. The UPR responds by repairing and removing misfolded proteins and, if necessary, initiates apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that the UPR is not only involved in depression, but that its activation causes a depressive phenotype. The hippocampi of rats were directly infused with 500\\xa0ng of tunicamycin (TM), an agent that initiates the UPR by blocking N-terminal glycosylation. Three to 8\\xa0days post-surgery, the rats showed depressive behavior in escape latency, forced swim despair, sucrose preference anhedonia, and also physiological signs of depression like decreased weight. Further, these behavioral changes were associated with enhanced expression of key UPR genes and proteins in the hippocampus. We propose that this model will make an excellent tool for studying depression and for understanding pathways that are affected by the UPR which directly causes depressive behavior.']},\n",

Consequently, the available treatments are far from satisfactory as it is estimated that up to 30% of patients are resistant to conventional treatment. Recent comprehensive evidence has been accumulated which suggests that inflammation may be implied in the etiology of this disease. Here we investigated ketamine as an innovative treatment strategy due to its immune-modulating capacities. In a murine model of LPS-induced depressive-like behavior we demonstrated that a single dose of ketamine restores the LPS-induced depressive-like alterations. These behavioral effects are associated with i/ a reversal of anxiety and reduced self-care, ii/ a decrease in parenchymal cytokine production, iii/ a modulation of the microglial reactivity and iv/ a decrease in microglial quinolinic acid production that is correlated with plasmatic peripheral production. In a translational approach, we show that kynurenic acid to quinolinic acid ratio is a predictor of ketamine response in treatment-resistant depressed patients and that the reduction in quinolinic acid after a ketamine infusion is a predictor of the reduction in MADRS score. Our results suggest that microglia is a key therapeutic target and that quinolinic acid is a biomarker of ketamine response in major depressive disorder.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Depression is a major mental health condition and is expected be the most debilitating and widespread health disorder by 2030. Tuberculosis (TB) is also a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and interestingly, is a common comorbidity of depression. As such, much attention has been paid to the association between these 2 pathologies. Based on clinical reports, the association between TB and depression seems to be bidirectional, with a substantial overlap in symptoms between the 2 conditions. TB infection or reactivation may precipitate depression, likely as a consequence of the host's inflammatory response and/or dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Nevertheless, few studies have considered whether patients with depression are at a higher risk for TB. In this review, we discuss the hypotheses on the association between depression and TB, highlighting the immuno-inflammatory response and lipid metabolism as potential mechanisms. Improving our understanding of the interplay between these 2 disorders should help guide TB clinical care and prevention both in patients with comorbid depression and in the general population.\"]},\n",

Our previous work reported that impaired negative regulators for the TLR pathways are associated with MDD. This study aimed to assess the association between the severity of depression and the intracellular microRNAs that regulate TLR4 signaling in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes from MDD patients. The severity of MDD before and after antidepressant treatment was determined by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the levels of intracellular regulatory microRNAs, including let-7e, miR-21-5p miR-145, miR-223, miR-146a, and miR-155, in PBMCs and monocytes isolated from 43 healthy controls and 84 patients with MDD before and after treatment with antidepressants. Assays of PBMCs showed that the levels of let-7e, miR-146a, and miR-155 were lower in MDD patients than in healthy controls and were significantly higher after than before treatment in the 69 patients who completed treatment with antidepressants for four weeks. Levels of miR-146a and miR-155 in monocytes were lower in MDD patients than in controls and were increased in the former after antidepressant treatment. Multiple linear regression analyses found that let-7e and miR-146a expression before treatment was inversely correlated with severity of depression, whereas miR-155 before treatment was directly correlated with severity of depression. These findings suggest that intracellular regulatory microRNAs which regulate TLR4 signaling are aberrantly expressed in patients with MDD and that these levels are ameliorated by antidepressant treatment.']},\n",

Therefore, in this study we investigated whether the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) could be associated with alterations in mitochondrial apoptotic signaling in the prefrontal cortex of male and female Wistar rats with depressive-like behavior. To that end, we measured LPS-induced alterations in the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in mitochondria and cytosol of PFC of female and male rats, as well as the levels of cleaved cytosolic PARP-1. We also measured the mitochondrial levels of GR and its phosphoisoforms pGR232 and pGR246, as well as the mRNA levels of two GR-regulated mitochondrial genes, COX-1 and COX-3. We discovered that although seven-day LPS treatment evoked depressive-like behavior and induced apoptosis in the PFC of both sexes, it affected apoptotic cascades in both sexes differently. In females the treatment initiated both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cascade, while in males only intrinsic cascade was engaged. Alterations in intrinsic apoptotic pathway were more associated with GR alterations in males, where LPS treatment decreased levels of mitochondrial GR and increased pGR232/pGR246 ratio. Alterations in mitochondrial GR could be associated with changes in expression of genes involved in oxidative metabolism in the PFC of this sex, and could, in combination with elevated levels of BCL-2 and decreased levels of BAX detected in this cell fraction, mitigate the detrimental effect of LPS on mitochondria in male PFC.']},\n",

In recent years, however, the importance of algae as sources of functional ingredients has been recognized due to their health beneficial effects. In this study, we evaluated the antidepressant-like activities of ethanol extract of Aurantiochytrium sp. (EEA) in the forced swimming test (FST)-induced depression in ICR mice. Imipramine, a commercially available tricyclic antidepressant drug, was used as positive control. Animals were administered EEA orally for 14 consecutive days and were subjected to the locomotor activity testing. Additionally, changes in gene expression in mice brain were assessed by real-time PCR and microarray assays to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of EEA. We found that the immobility time in FST was significantly reduced in the EEA-treated mice compared to that of in the control mice. Microarray and real-time PCR results revealed that EEA treatment induced changes in several genes in mice brain associated with pro-inflammation and dopaminergic, cholinergic, glutamatergic, and serotonergic synapses. It has previously been reported that several cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, which mediate neuroinflammation, are also responsible for indirectly altering brain neurotransmitter levels in neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, the regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in EEA-administered mice brain is considered to contribute to the enhancement of neurotransmitter systems-related gene expression in our study. Moreover, our in vitro study suggested that squalene, a component produced by Aurantiochytrium, was one of the active substances in EEA. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that Aurantiochytrium sp. can reduce neuroinflammation that may contribute to the modulation of the neurotransmitter systems, which could underlie its antistress and antidepressant effects.']},\n",

The previous work by our group has suggested that certain proinflammatory cytokines are inversely related to patient-reported levels of fatigue. To date, these findings have not been validated. This study aims to validate this observation. Blood levels of seven cytokines were measured in 120 patients with pSS from the United Kingdom Primary Sjögren's Syndrome Registry and 30 age-matched healthy non-fatigued controls. Patient-reported scores for fatigue were classified according to severity and compared to cytokine levels using analysis of variance. The differences between cytokines in cases and controls were evaluated using Wilcoxon test. A logistic regression model was used to determine the most important identifiers of fatigue. Five cytokines, interferon-γ-induced protein-10 (IP-10), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interferon-α (IFNα), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and lymphotoxin-α (LT-α) were significantly higher in patients with pSS (n\\u2009=\\u2009120) compared to non-fatigued controls (n\\u2009=\\u200930). Levels of two proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α (p\\u2009=\\u20090.021) and LT-α (p\\u2009=\\u20090.043), were inversely related to patient-reported levels of fatigue. Cytokine levels, disease-specific and clinical parameters as well as pain, anxiety, and depression were used as predictors in our validation model. The model correctly identifies fatigue levels with 85% accuracy. Consistent with the original study, pain, depression, and proinflammatory cytokines appear to be the most powerful predictors of fatigue in pSS. TNF-α and LT-α have an inverse relationship with fatigue severity in pSS challenging the notion that proinflammatory cytokines directly mediate fatigue in chronic immunological conditions.\"]},\n",

Though the exact mechanism of BD is unknown, neuroinflammation is one of the numerous investigated etiopathophysiological causes of BD. This article presents a systematic review of the data regarding brain inflammation evaluating microglia, astrocytes, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and other inflammatory markers in postmortem BD brain samples. This systematic review was performed according to PRISMA recommendations, and relevant studies were identified by searching the PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, LILACS, IBECS, and Web of Science databases for peer-reviewed journal articles published by March 2019. Quality of included studies appraised using the QUADAS-2 tool. Among the 1814 articles included in the primary screening, 51 articles measured inflammatory markers in postmortem BD brain samples. A number of studies have shown evidence of inflammation in BD postmortem brain samples. However, an absolute statement cannot be concluded whether neuroinflammation is present in BD due to the large number of studies did not evaluate the presence of infiltrating peripheral immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, cytokines levels, and microglia activation in the same postmortem brain sample. For example, out of 15 studies that evaluated microglia cells markers, 8 studies found no effect of BD on these cells. Similarly, 17 out of 51 studies evaluating astrocytes markers, 9 studies did not find any effect of BD on astrocyte cells, whereas 8 studies found a decrease and 2 studies presented both increase and decrease in different brain regions. In addition, multiple factors account for the variability across the studies, including postmortem interval, brain area studied, age at diagnosis, undergoing treatment, and others. Future analyses should rectify these potential sources of heterogeneity and reach a consensus regarding the inflammatory markers in postmortem BD brain samples.']},\n",

Inflammation has been implicated as a significant driver for the development of tolerance to opioids. Recent studies show that chronic morphine in mice results in gut microbial dysbiosis and inflammation in the colon. In the present study, we examined whether colonic inflammation results in tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine. Colonic inflammation was induced in mice by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene sulfonic acid. The development of antinociceptive tolerance was determined by warm-water tail-immersion assay in mice implanted with 25-, 50-, or 75-mg morphine pellet. Colonic inflammation significantly enhanced the rate at which tolerance developed in each cohort of chronic morphine-treated mice. At the lowest dose of morphine pellet (25 mg), antinociceptive tolerance only developed in the presence of colonic inflammation, whereas in 50- and 75-mg pelleted mice, tolerance developed faster in the inflamed animals than in the noninflamed mice. The enhanced antinociceptive tolerance was attenuated with daily administration of peripheral opioid receptor antagonist, 6']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and heterogeneous disorder. Although there are many treatment options for MDD, patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remain prevalent, wherein delayed time to response results in inferior chances of achieving remission. Recently, therapeutics have been developed that depart from the traditional monoamine hypothesis of depression and focus instead on the glutamatergic, GABAergic, opioidergic, and inflammatory systems. The literature suggests that the foregoing systems are implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD and preclinical trials have informed the development of pharmaceuticals using these systems as therapeutic targets. Pharmaceuticals that target the glutamatergic system include ketamine, esketamine, and rapastinel; brexanolone and SAGE-217 target the GABAergic system; minocycline targets the inflammatory system; and the combinatory agent buprenorphine + samidorphan targets the opioidergic system. The aforementioned agents have shown efficacy in treating MDD in clinical trials. Of particular clinical relevance are those agents targeting the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems as they exhibit rapid response relative to conventional antidepressants. Rapid response pharmaceuticals have the potential to transform the treatment of MDD, demonstrating reduction in depressive symptoms within 24 hours, as opposed to weeks noted with conventional antidepressants. Novel therapeutics have the potential to improve both patient mood symptomatology and economical productivity, reducing the debased human capital costs associated with MDD. Furthermore, a selection of therapeutic targets provides diverse treatment options which may be beneficial to the patient considering the heterogeneity of MDD.']},\n",

The aim of this study was to explore the influence of gut bacterial depletion from early adolescence on adult immunological and neurobehavioral responses in mice with experimental-autoimmune-encephalomyelitis (EAE). We used an animal model of gut microbiota depletion induced by antibiotics from weaning to adulthood to assess clinical signs, cognitive function and depression-and anxiety-related symptoms in non-EAE and EAE-induced mice. We measured levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-10 in serum, and BDNF, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) in the hippocampus. Antibiotic-treated mice displayed a significant delay in the onset of clinical symptoms of EAE. However, a higher severity of EAE was found between days 19-22 post-immunization in antibiotics-treated mice, while a reduction in the clinical signs of MS was observed at days 24-25 post-immunization. Antibiotic administration decreased IFN-γ and IL-17A levels and increased IL-10 in serum of EAE-induced mice. Antibiotic treatment significantly decreased hippocampal BDNF and enhanced learning and memory impairments in EAE-induced mice. However, no significant changes were found in non-EAE mice. Non-EAE and EAE mice treated with antibiotics exhibited increased anxiety-related behaviors, whereas depression-related symptoms and increased hippocampal TNF-α and IL-1β were only observed in EAE-induced mice treated with antibiotics. This study supports the view that depletion of gut microbiota by antibiotics from weaning profoundly impacts adult immunological and neurobehavioral responses.']},\n",

The traditional role of NPFF is mediation of the pain response, and it displays both anti-opioid and pro-opioid actions through central nervous system. In the recent decade, additional evidence has revealed some untraditional features of NPFF, such as regulation of the neuroendocrine system, energy homeostasis, anti-inflammation, pain transmission, and peripheral modulation of adipose tissue macrophages. Neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (NPFFR2) is a physiological receptor of NPFF, and the actions of NPFF may occur through downstream NPFFR2 signaling. NPFF and NPFFR2 increase the neuronal activity in various areas of the hypothalamus to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the autonomic nervous system, food intake, and energy balance. These underlying cellular mechanisms have been explored in the past few years. Here, we review the impact of NPFF and related RF-amide peptides on hypothalamic function. The interaction of NPFF with NPFFR2 in the hypothalamus is emphasized, and NPFF-NPFFR2 system may represent an important therapeutic target in hypothalamic-related disorders in the future.']},\n",

These medications have complex pharmacology and are associated with significant endocrine and metabolic side effects. This class of medications also carries FDA black box warnings due to increased risk of death in elderly patients. Clinical reports indicate that patients treated with these medications are more susceptible to infections; however, the underlying mechanisms/pharmacology are unclear. We have previously reported that risperidone and it's active metabolite distributes to the bone marrow in clinically relevant concentrations in preclinical species, leading us to hypothesize that the hematopoietic system may be impacted by these medications. To test this hypothesis, using proteomic and cytokine array technology, we evaluated the expression of genes involved in inflammatory and immune function following short term (5 days) and longer term (4 weeks) treatment in healthy animals. We report that low-dose risperidone treatment results in global immunosuppression in mice, observed following 5 days of dosing and exacerbated with longer term drug treatment (4 weeks). These data are consistent with increased susceptibility to infection in patients administered these medications and have profound implications for the increasing off-label prescribing to vulnerable patient populations including children and the elderly.\"]},\n",

A growing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory processes may play a significant role in the pathophysiology and progression of the disease. The comorbidity of MDDs with many other medical conditions, for example autoimmune diseases (ADs) caused by inflammation, has been observed on numerous occasions. In both cases, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory agents are observed. Furthermore, higher rates of inflammatory markers are associated with a poorer response to antidepressant treatment. Additionally, the presence of any AD is associated with higher prevalence of depression and may reduce the chance of effective therapy. Interestingly, the administration of several anti-inflammatory agents used in AD treatment is positively correlated with a reduction of depressive symptoms. In conclusion, the factors contributing to the coexistence of depression as well as affecting antidepressant treatment effectiveness may lead to an alteration of the cytokine profiles in many autoimmune diseases.']},\n",

Systemic chronic low-grade inflammation has been reported to be associated with MDD progression by affecting monoaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission.

Here, we evaluated 184 adolescent patients who were experiencing their first episode of depressive disorder, and the same number of healthy individuals was included as controls. We tested the serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IgE, 14 different types of food antigen-specific IgG, histamine, homocysteine, S100 calcium-binding protein B, and diamine oxidase. We were not able to find any significant differences in the serum levels of hs-CRP or TNF-α between the two groups. However, the histamine level of the patients (12.35\\u202fμM) was significantly higher than that of the controls (9.73\\u202fμM, P\\u202f<\\u202f0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). Moreover, significantly higher serum food antigen-specific IgG positive rates were also found in the patient group. Furthermore, over 80% of patients exhibited prolonged food intolerance with elevated levels of serum histamine, leading to hyperpermeability of the blood-brain barrier, which has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD. Hence, prolonged high levels of serum histamine could be a risk factor for depressive disorders, and antihistamine release might represent a novel therapeutic strategy for depression treatment.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder associated with varied prognosis, chronic course, and duration of illness with reduced quality of life. One factor that significantly contributes to the relevant disease burden of MDD is the heterogeneous treatment response patients experience with current treatment options. A variety of experimental protocols in humans and animals have highlighted that inflammation and neuroinflammation are relevant biological factors that interact with external stimuli and neurophysiological mechanisms, and can trigger MDD. It is well established that exercise is efficacious in treating mild to moderate depression with response rates comparable to mainstream therapies such as antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. Several studies have shown that physical exercise is beneficial for a range of chronic diseases. Indeed, physical exercise can promote molecular changes that swerve a chronic pro-inflammatory state to an anti-inflammatory state in both periphery and central nervous system. The changes caused by physical exercise include an increase in PGC1α gene expression, a transcriptional co-activator involved in reducing the synthesis and releasing of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines. PGC1α changes the metabolism of kynurenine towards, and, in turn, it reduces glutamatergic neurotoxicity. Moreover, some studies have shown that physical exercise promotes alterations in the circuitry of monoaminergic neurotransmission, at least in some aspects, through the effects on the release of proinflammatory cytokines. This review will highlight the effects of physical exercise as therapy and its relation with the biological mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of MDD, with particular emphasis in the interactions among physical exercise, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neuroinflammation, and with the neurotransmitters underlying the main brain circuits involved in the MDD.']},\n",

In both adult and young rats, sepsis impaired the inhibitory avoidance task performance and increased immobility time in the forced swimming test. However, the adult septic rats had a higher immobility time compared to the young rats. Both sepsis and aging induced brain inflammation and oxidative damage and increased Aβ content. Sepsis along with aging had additive effects on hippocampal interleukin-1 levels and prefrontal carbonyl levels.

PC12 cells were divided into control (no treatment, NC), ketamine treatment (KT), ketamine treatment with the inhibition of NF-κB (KI), and ketamine treatment with the overexpression of NF-κB (KO) group. Blood serum samples were collected from patients with MDD (n = 10) and healthy controls (n = 10) between 2015 and 2017. Ketamine significantly increased the viability and decreased the apoptosis of PC12 cells in KT and KI vs. NC group, but not in KO group. The levels of anti-apoptotic molecules and Krebs cycle enzymes were significantly increased in KI vs. KT group, while the levels of pro-apoptotic molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines were decreased in KI vs. KT group. In addition, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of MDD patients were significantly increased. The antidepressant effect of ketamine was enhanced in KI and reduced in KO group.

Studies have found that people with major depression have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example, IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein. In schizophrenia, many reports have described raised levels of cytokines, for example, IL-6; and meta-analyses have confirmed these findings. Microglia cells are important in inflammatory processes, and positron emission tomography studies have shown microglia activation in both depression and schizophrenia.As a consequence of the above findings, immunomodulation is widely discussed as a potential treatment approach in both major depression and schizophrenia. The COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib was found to have a significant positive effect on major depression, not only in single studies but also in meta-analyses. Celecoxib has also been studied in schizophrenia and has shown efficacy, in particular, in early disease stages. The mixed COX inhibitor aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) seems to have both protective and therapeutic effects on schizophrenia.This paper discusses the hypothesized role of inflammation in major depression and schizophrenia, including markers of inflammation; pertinent studies on celecoxib and aspirin; and additional immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['This article is a comprehensive review of the literature pertaining to the antidepressant effects and mechanisms of regular tea consumption. Meta-data supplemented with recent observational studies were first analyzed to assess the association between tea consumption and depression risk. The literature reported risk ratios (RR) were 0.69 with 95% confidence intervals of 0.62-0.77. Next, we thoroughly reviewed human trials, mouse models, and in vitro experiments to determine the predominant mechanisms underlying the observed linear relationship between tea consumption and reduced risk of depression. Current theories on the neurobiology of depression were utilized to map tea-mediated mechanisms of antidepressant activity onto an integrated framework of depression pathology. The major nodes within the network framework of depression included hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, inflammation, weakened monoaminergic systems, reduced neurogenesis/neuroplasticity, and poor microbiome diversity affecting the gut-brain axis. We detailed how each node has subsystems within them, including signaling pathways, specific target proteins, or transporters that interface with compounds in tea, mediating their antidepressant effects. A major pathway was found to be the ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway, up-regulated by a number of compounds in tea including teasaponin, L-theanine, EGCG and combinations of tea catechins and their metabolites. Black tea theaflavins and EGCG are potent anti-inflammatory agents via down-regulation of NF-κB signaling. Multiple compounds in tea are effective modulators of dopaminergic activity and the gut-brain axis. Taken together, our findings show that constituents found in all major tea types, predominantly L-theanine, polyphenols and polyphenol metabolites, are capable of functioning through multiple pathways simultaneously to collectively reduce the risk of depression.']},\n",

During this period, there is increased neuroplasticity and heightened vulnerability to stress and inflammation. The gut microbiome regulates stress and inflammatory responses and can alter brain chemistry and behaviour. However, the role of the gut microbiota during pubertal development remains largely uninvestigated. The current study examined gut manipulation with probiotics during puberty in CD1 mice on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune responses and enduring effects on anxiety- and depression-like behaviours and stress-reactivity in adulthood. Probiotics reduced LPS-induced sickness behaviour at 12\\u202fh in females and at 48\\u202fh following LPS treatment in males. Probiotics also reduced LPS-induced changes in body weight at 48\\u202fh post-treatment in females. Probiotic treatment also prevented LPS-induced increases in pro- and anti-inflammatory peripheral cytokines at 8\\u202fh following LPS treatment, reduced central cytokine mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and PFC, and prevented LPS-induced changes to in the gut microbiota. A single exposure to LPS during puberty resulted in enduring depression-like behaviour in female mice, and anxiety-like behaviour in male mice in adulthood. However, pubertal exposure to probiotics prevented enduring LPS-induced depression-like behaviour in females and anxiety-like behaviors in males. Moreover, probiotics altered toll-like receptor-4 activity in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in males in response to a novel stressor in adulthood. Our results suggest that the gut microbiome plays an important role in pubertal neurodevelopment. These findings indicate that exposure to probiotics during puberty mitigates inflammation and decreases stress-induced vulnerabilities to emotional behaviours later in life, in a sex-specific manner.']},\n",

Although the classic infectious TORCH pathogens (ie, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus [CMV], herpes simplex virus) are known to be directly teratogenic, emerging evidence suggests that these infections represent the most extreme end of a much larger spectrum of injury. We present the accumulating evidence that prenatal exposure to a wide variety of viral and bacterial infections-or simply inflammation-may subtly alter fetal brain development, leading to neuropsychiatric consequences for the child later in life. The link between influenza infections in pregnant women and an increased risk for development of schizophrenia in their children was first described more than 30 years ago. Since then, evidence suggests that a range of infections during pregnancy may also increase risk for autism spectrum disorder and depression in the child. Subsequent studies in animal models demonstrated that both pregnancy infections and inflammation can result in direct injury to neurons and neural progenitor cells or indirect injury through activation of microglia and astrocytes, which can trigger cytokine production and oxidative stress. Infectious exposures can also alter placental serotonin production, which can perturb neurotransmitter signaling in the developing brain. Clinically, detection of these subtle injuries to the fetal brain is difficult. As the neuropsychiatric impact of perinatal infections or inflammation may not be known for decades after birth, our construct for defining teratogenic infections in pregnancy (eg, TORCH) based on congenital anomalies is insufficient to capture the full adverse impact on the child. We discuss the clinical implications of this body of evidence and how we might place greater emphasis on prevention of prenatal infections. For example, increasing uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine is a key strategy to reduce perinatal infections and the risk for fetal brain injury. An important research gap exists in understanding how antibiotic therapy during pregnancy affects the fetal inflammatory load and how to avoid inflammation-mediated injury to the fetal brain. In summary, we discuss the current evidence and mechanisms linking infections and inflammation with the increased lifelong risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in the child, and how we might improve prenatal care to protect the fetal brain.']},\n",

Recently, the gut microbiota, a huge and dynamic ecosystem made up of billions of microorganisms living in our intestine, has been shown to regulate many important functions for human health. Indeed, the gut microbiota is known to influence our metabolism, our immune system as well as our nervous system with consequences for brain functions, mood and behaviour. We have shown that heavy and chronic alcohol consumption induced important changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, the microbial changes are associated with the severity of depression, anxiety and alcohol craving that are important factors predicting the risk of relapse. This suggests the existence of a gut-brain axis in alcohol dependence and supports the development of new therapeutic alternatives, targeting the gut microbiota, in the management of alcohol dependence.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The incidence of depression is almost twice as high in the spinally injured population compared to the general population. While this incidence has long been attributed to the psychological, economic, and social burdens that accompany spinal cord injury (SCI), data from animal studies indicate that the biology of SCI may play an important role in the development of depression. Inflammation has been shown to impact stress response in rodents and humans, and inflammatory cytokines have been associated with depression for decades. The inflammation inherent to SCI may disrupt necessary mechanisms of mental homeostasis, such as serotonin production, dopamine production, and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. Additionally, gut dysbiosis that occurs after SCI can exacerbate inflammation and may cause further mood and behavior changes. These mediators combined may significantly contribute to the rise in depression seen after SCI. Currently, there are no therapies specific to depression after SCI. Elucidation of the molecular pathways that contribute to SCI-specific depression is crucial for the understanding of this disease and its potential treatments.']},\n",

Intensive research efforts are being made to achieve an integrated view about the pathophysiological role of NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in such disorders. Evidence is also emerging that the pharmacological modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome by phytochemicals could represent a promising molecular target for the therapeutic management of neurological, psychiatric, metabolic, and inflammatory diseases. The present review article has been intended to provide an integrated and critical overview of the available clinical and experimental evidence about the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiology of neurological, psychiatric, metabolic, and inflammatory diseases, including PD, AD, MS, depression, obesity, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and intestinal inflammation. Special attention has been paid to highlight and critically discuss current scientific evidence on the effects of phytochemicals on NLRP3 inflammasome pathways and their potential in counteracting central neuroinflammation, metabolic alterations, and immune/inflammatory responses in such diseases.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Obesity has been associated with cognitive and behavioral syndromes. Individuals who are obese have higher risk for developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and dementia than non-obese. Conversely, patients with neuropsychiatric conditions may exhibit some features that contribute to obesity development such as unhealthy behaviors and treatment with drugs that increase appetite. This review addresses the multiple pathways implicated in the relationship between obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders, mainly mood disorders, schizophrenia, and major neurocognitive disorder or dementia. Both obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by a low-grade systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. Obesity is frequently accompanied by neuroendocrine changes, particularly involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Indeed, activation of the stress system is commonly seen as a trigger for mood episodes, psychosis exacerbation, and cognitive decline. Growing evidence suggests the role of gut microbiota in obesity and brain functioning through the modulation of the inflammatory response and HPA axis. Owing to the intricate relationship between obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders, tackling one of them may affect the other. Therefore, a better understanding of the pathways underlying the link between obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders can contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies for these conditions.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"A considerable number of human diseases have an inflammatory component, and a key mediator of immune activation and inflammation is inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which produces nitric oxide (NO) from l-arginine. Overexpressed or dysregulated iNOS has been implicated in numerous pathologies including sepsis, cancer, neurodegeneration, and various types of pain. Extensive knowledge has been accumulated about the roles iNOS plays in different tissues and organs. Additionally, X-ray crystal and cryogenic\\xa0electron microscopy structures have shed new insights on the structure and regulation of this enzyme. Many potent iNOS inhibitors with high selectivity over related NOS isoforms, neuronal NOS, and endothelial NOS, have been discovered, and these drugs have shown promise in animal models of endotoxemia, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, arthritis, and other disorders. A major issue in iNOS inhibitor development is that promising results in animal studies have not translated to humans; there are no iNOS inhibitors approved for human use. In addition to assay limitations, both the dual modalities of iNOS and NO in disease states (ie, protective vs harmful effects) and the different roles and localizations of NOS isoforms create challenges for therapeutic intervention. This review summarizes the structure, function, and regulation of iNOS, with focus on the development of iNOS inhibitors (historical and recent). A better understanding of iNOS' complex functions is necessary before specific drug candidates can be identified for classical indications such as sepsis, heart failure, and pain; however, newer promising indications for iNOS inhibition, such as depression, neurodegenerative disorders, and epilepsy, have been discovered.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Chronic low-grade inflammation has been observed in major depression and other major psychiatric disorders and has been implicated in metabolic changes that are commonly associated with these disorders. This raises the possibility that the effects of dysfunctional metabolism may facilitate changes in neuronal structure and function which contribute to neuroprogression. Such changes may have implications for the progress from major depression to dementia in the elderly patient. The purpose of this review is to examine the contribution of inflammation and hypercortisolaemia, which are frequently associated with major depression, to neurodegeneration and how they detrimentally impact on brain energy metabolism. A key factor in these adverse events is insulin insensitivity caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines in association with desensitised glucocorticoid receptors. Identifying the possible metabolic changes initiated by inflammation opens new targets to ameliorate the adverse metabolic changes. This has resulted in the identification of dietary and drug targets which are of interest in the development of a new generation of psychotropic drugs.']},\n",

The present study used latent growth curve models to examine pathways between family adversity in infancy, depressive symptoms in childhood, body mass index (BMI) in childhood, and inflammation in adolescence (age\\u202f=\\u202f16-18). The study is an adolescent follow-up of infants from working-class communities around Santiago, Chile, who participated in a preventive trial of iron supplementation at 6\\u202fmonths of age. Anthropometrics, stressful life events, maternal depression, socioeconomic status, and developmental assessments were measured at 12\\u202fmonths, 5\\u202fyears, 10\\u202fyears, and adolescence. In adolescence, participants provided blood samples for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) assessment. Greater exposure to early adversity in the form of interpersonal conflict stress in infancy indirectly associated with increased hsCRP through its association to increased intercept and slope of childhood BMI. Depressive symptoms at any time were not directly or indirectly associated with increased hsCRP. These findings contribute to our understanding of how early family adversity and its associations with obesity and depressive symptoms across childhood are linked to low-grade, chronic inflammation in adolescence. The model identified as best capturing the data supported the pivotal role of childhood BMI in explaining how early-life adversity is associated with inflammation in adolescence.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Andrographolide is compound extracted from Andrographis paniculata (A. paniculata), a traditional herb that has been used in ancient China and other parts of eastern Asia to treat an array of disorders, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and laryngitis, for a very long history. The mechanisms of action of andrographolide in disease prevention and/or therapy include anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, and/or pro-apoptosis. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that andrographolide can cross the blood brain barrier and distribute into different brain regions, and therefore its pharmacological effects in the central nervous system (CNS) have begun to be revealed in recent years. For example, andrographolide has been reported to reduce brain infarct volume in several models of cerebral ischemia. In models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), andrographolide not only reduces Aβ aggregation, but suppresses neuroinflammatory response and synaptic dysfunction, which could be evidenced by the reversal of microglia-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as AD-associated decreases in synaptic proteins, such as postsynaptic membrane dense substance-95. Andrographolide may also inhibit the onset and/or progression of Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and surgery- or diabetes-induced cognitive impairment. Further, andrographolide has been shown to inhibit chronic stress-induced abnormalities in serum corticosterone levels, mood-associated behavior, and hippocampal neurogenesis, suggesting that andrographolide may have a potential to treat psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. In this review, we summarize and discuss the pharmacological effects of andrographolide in the CNS in hope of revealing more possibilities of andrographolide in disease prevention and/or therapy.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['As is reported, the incidence and prevalence of depression are higher in women than in men, but the cause of this sex difference remains elusive. Although recent studies implicated that over-activated microglia played a crucial role in depression, whether hippocampal microglia associates with the sex difference of depressive-like behaviours is intriguing. In the present study, both male and female mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 4\\u202fweeks. Behavioural tests were performed to evaluate depressive-like phenotypes, while several microglia-related biomarkers and neurotrophic factor in hippocampi were detected to analyse sex difference. As a result, CUMS interfered with the body weight gain, sucrose preference and spontaneous activity in mice of both sexes. However, this effect tended to be more impressive in females. Generally, hippocampal microglia were activated regardless of sex, but the expressions of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors induced by CUMS were sex-specific. Chronic stress increased hippocampal iNOS and IL-1β mRNA levels only in male mice, while upregulated TNF-α mRNA just in females. Meanwhile, the expressions of hippocampal IL-10, Arg-1 and IL-1ra were all downregulated in CUMS females rather than males. In addition, though the ratios of the pro- vs. anti-inflammatory cytokines elevated after the stress paradigm in both sexes, we noticed more remarkable trends in female mice regarding TNF-α/IL-10 and iNOS/Arg-1. This discovery suggested that females were inclined to be more pro-inflammatory after stress. Afterwards, we observed that the expressions of BDNF and its receptor TrkB in hippocampus decreased greater in female compared to male mice when facing stress stimulations. Furthermore, the depressive-like behaviours were correlated to BDNF mRNA quantities in both sex mice, and there was also a sex-specific relationship between BDNF and hippocampal microglia-related inflammatory biomarkers. Collectively, our study speculated that the imbalance of microglial pro- and anti-inflammatory states as well as the BDNF-TrkB-dependent pathway in hippocampus is involved in the depressive-like behaviours. The \"microglia-neuroinflammation-BDNF\" interconnection may be a fundamental mechanism for sex differences in depression.']},\n",

An imbalanced gastrointestinal ecosystem (dysbiosis) seems to be a contributor to the development and maintenance of several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, the three disorders are frequently associated as demonstrated by the high comorbidity rates. In this review, we introduce gut microbiota and its role in both normal and pathological processes; then, we discuss the importance of the gut-brain axis as well as the role of oxidative stress and inflammation as mediators of the pathological processes in which dysbiosis is involved. Specific sections pertain the role of the altered gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, depression, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The therapeutic implications of microbiota manipulation are briefly discussed. Finally, a conclusion comments on the possible role of dysbiosis as a common pathogenetic contributor (via oxidative stress and inflammation) shared by the three disorders.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Several lines of evidence show that systematic exposure to negative social acts at the workplace i.e., workplace bullying, results in symptoms of depression and anxiety among those targeted. However, little is known about the association between bullying, inflammatory genes and sleep problems. In the present study, we examined the indirect association between exposure to negative social acts and sleep through distress, as moderated by the miR-146a genotype. The study was based on a nationally representative survey of 1179 Norwegian employees drawn from the Norwegian Central Employee Register by Statistics Norway. Exposure to workplace bullying was measured with the 9-item version of Negative Acts Questionnaire - Revised (NAQ-R) inventory. Seventeen items from Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) was used to measure distress. Insomnia was assessed with three items reflecting problems with sleep onset, maintenance of sleep and early morning awakening. Genotyping with regard to miR-146a rs2910164, previously linked to inflammatory processes, was carried out using Taqman assay. The data revealed that individuals systematically exposed to negative social acts at the workplace reported higher levels of sleep problems than non-exposed individuals. Moreover, the relationship between distress induced by exposure to negative social acts and insomnia was significantly stronger for individuals with the miR-146a GG genotype. Thus, the miR-146a genotype moderated the association between distress and insomnia among individuals exposed to negative social acts. The present report support the hypothesis that inflammation could play a role in stress-induced insomnia among individuals exposed to workplace bullying.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Globally, psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are becoming more prevalent. Although the exact pathological alterations are not yet clear, recent studies have demonstrated that widespread changes of very complex metabolic pathways may partially underlie the pathophysiology of many psychiatric diseases. Thus, more attention should be directed to metabolic-based therapeutic interventions in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Emerging evidence from numerous studies suggests that administration of exogenous ketone supplements, such as ketone salts or ketone esters, generates rapid and sustained nutritional ketosis and metabolic changes, which may evoke potential therapeutic effects in cases of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including psychiatric diseases. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the current information on ketone supplementation as a potential therapeutic tool for psychiatric disorders. Ketone supplementation elevates blood levels of the ketone bodies: D-β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and acetone. These compounds, either directly or indirectly, beneficially affect the mitochondria, glycolysis, neurotransmitter levels, activity of free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3), hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), and histone deacetylase, as well as functioning of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) expression. The result of downstream cellular and molecular changes is a reduction in the pathophysiology associated with various psychiatric disorders. We conclude that supplement-induced nutritional ketosis leads to metabolic changes and improvements, for example, in mitochondrial function and inflammatory processes, and suggest that development of specific adjunctive ketogenic protocols for psychiatric diseases should be actively pursued.']},\n",

This review provides an update on the current state of research of the neurobiological mechanisms of stress resilience. We focus on physiological and transcriptional adaptations of specific brain circuits, the role of cellular and humoral factors of the immune system, the gut microbiota, and changes at the interface between the brain and the periphery, the blood-brain barrier.

       "  'abstract': ['In mammals, the circadian pacemaker resides in the paired suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and influences a multitude of biological processes, including the sleep-wake rhythm. Circadian rhythms regulate diverse physiologic processes, including homeostatic functions of steroid hormones and their receptors. Perturbation of these rhythms is associated with pathogenic conditions such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorder and depression. Clock genes ultimately control a vast array of circadian rhythms involved in physiology and behavior. They regulate several diseases described above. Chronotherapy is especially relevant when the risk and/or intensity of symptoms of a disease vary predictably over time. The effectiveness and toxicity of several drugs vary depending on the dosing time. Such chronopharmacological phenomena are influenced by not only the pharmacodynamics but also the pharmacokinetics of a medication. The underlying mechanisms are associated with the 24-h rhythms of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes under the control of the circadian clock. Identifying a rhythmic marker based on the molecular clock for choosing dosing time can lead to the progress and diffusion of chronopharmacotherapy. To monitor the rhythmic markers such as clock genes, it might be useful to choose the most appropriate time of a day for the administration of a drug, to increase its therapeutic effects and/or reduce its side effects. On the contrary, several drugs affect the molecular clock and alter the 24-h rhythms of various processes. Alterations in rhythmicity are sometimes associated with therapeutic effects, or it might lead to illness and altered homeostatic regulation. Furthermore, to produce new rhythmicity by manipulating the molecular clock of organs by rhythmic administration of drugs at altered feeding schedules appears to lead to a new concept of chronopharmacotherapy. An approach to increase the efficiency of pharmacotherapy is administering drugs at times when they are best tolerated. From the perspective of pharmaceutics, the application of biological rhythm to pharmacotherapy can be accomplished by the appropriate timing of administration of conventionally formulated tablets and capsules, and also by the use of special drug-delivery system to synchronize drug concentrations to the rhythms in disease activity. New drugs targeting the molecular clock are being developed to manage diseases in human. For instance, novel molecular mechanisms that mediate renal dysfunction in mice with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been identified by examining the relationship between the circadian clock and CKD aggravation. The inhibition of cell cycle regulatory factor ameliorated renal inflammation in a mouse model of CKD. A novel inhibitor of cell cycle regulatory factor has been identified, supporting the potential utility of cell cycle regulatory factor inhibition in the treatment of CKD. Although malignant phenotypes of triple-negative breast cancer are subject to circadian alterations, the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in defining this circadian change remains unclear. The effectiveness of anticancer drugs varies with the circadian dynamics of CSCs, which are regulated by the tumor microenvironmental factors. The finding reveals that the circadian dynamics of CSCs are regulated by the tumor microenvironment and provides a proof of principle of its implication for chronotherapy against triple-negative breast cancer. Therefore, we present an overview of the dosing-time-dependent alterations in therapeutic outcome and safety of a drug and the regulatory system of biological rhythm from the perspective of clock genes and the possibility of pharmacotherapy based on the molecular clock.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Mental- and physical-health conditions co-occur at a rate much higher than chance. Of patients who have a mental-health condition, more than half also have a physical disease, and these cases are associated with increased human suffering and societal cost. Comorbidity research to date has focused on co-occurring mental- and physical-health disorders separately, and relatively little research has examined the co-occurrence of mental- and physical-health dysfunction. In addition, even less is known about why mental- and physical-health dysfunction co-occurs or how to treat these cases. Thus, the aims of this article are to highlight the need for research at the intersection of physical- and mental-health dysfunction and to provide guidance on how to research cases of comorbidity. Toward these ends, we begin by presenting a selective overview of the possible role of biological processes in the co-occurrence of physical- and mental-health dysfunction using specific illustrative examples. Specifically, we outline how biological processes within the immune system and gastrointestinal system could underlie depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and their co-occurrence. We then advance and discuss a proposed research framework, including methodological and analytic guidance, that researchers could use when studying the phenomenon of co-occurring physical- and mental-health dysfunction.']},\n",

However, due to delayed and/or poor performance of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treating depressive symptoms, the role of the serotonergic system in depression has been recently questioned further. Evidence from recent studies suggests that increased inflammation and oxidative stress may play significant roles in the pathophysiology of depression. The consequences of these factors can lead to the neuroprogression of depression, involving neurodegeneration, astrocytic apoptosis, reduced neurogenesis, reduced plasticity (neuronal and synaptic), and enhanced immunoreactivity. Specifically, increased proinflammatory cytokine levels have been shown to activate the kynurenine pathway, which causes increased production of quinolinic acid (QA, an N-Methyl-D-aspartate agonist) and decreases the synthesis of serotonin. QA exerts many deleterious effects on the brain ']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Severe mental illnesses (SMI), including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, are associated with increased inflammation. Given diet's role in modulating inflammatory processes, excessive calorie-dense, nutrient-deficient processed food intake may contribute toward the heightened inflammation observed in SMI. This review assesses the evidence from observational and experimental studies to investigate how diet may affect physical and mental health outcomes in SMI through inflammation-related pathways. Cross-sectional studies indicate that individuals with SMI, particularly schizophrenia, consume more pro-inflammatory foods and fewer anti-inflammatory nutrients than the general population. Cohort studies indicate that high levels of dietary inflammation are associated with increased risk of developing depression, but there is currently a lack of evidence for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Randomized controlled trials show that dietary interventions improve symptoms of depression, but none have tested the extent to which these benefits are due to changes in inflammation. This review summarizes evidence on dietary inflammation in SMI, explores the directionality of these links, and discusses the potential use of targeted nutritional interventions for improving psychological well-being and physical health outcomes in SMI. Establishing the extent to which diet explains elevated levels of inflammatory markers observed in SMI is a priority for future research.\"]},\n",

A validated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (30 mg/kg i.p.), was also administered to an experimental group 30 min prior to LPS. Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated based on the duration of immobility in the forced swim test. To confirm that GM-CSF interferes with IDO induction in LPS treated mice, real-time PCR was used to quantify IDO mRNA expression. Furthermore, in order to study whether GM-CSF inhibits the TLR4/NF-ĸB signaling pathway, we measured levels ofpNF-ĸB and TLR4 by western blotting.',\n",

Immune-system activity has been implicated in the etiology of both depression and CVD, but it is unclear how inflammation contributes to sex differences in this comorbidity. This narrative review provides an updated synthesis of research examining the association of inflammation with depression and CVD, and their comorbidity in women. Recent research provides evidence of pro-inflammatory states and sex differences associated with alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the serotonin/kynurenine pathway, that likely contribute to the development of depression and CVD. Changes to inflammatory cytokines in relation to reproductive periods of hormonal fluctuation (i.e. the menstrual cycle, perinatal period and menopause) are highlighted and provide a greater understanding of the unique vulnerability women experience in developing both depressed mood and adverse cardiovascular events. Inflammatory biomarkers hold substantial promise when combined with a patient's reproductive and mental health history to aid in the prediction, identification and treatment of the women most at risk for CVD and depression. However, more research is needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying inflammation in relation to their comorbidity, and how these findings can be translated to improve women's health.\"]},\n",

In this review, we underscore specific pathways and mechanisms by which the gut microbiome can promote the development of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. First, we review the involvement of the stress response and immune system activation in the development of depression and anxiety. Then, we examine germ-free murine models used to uncover the role of the gut microbiome in developing and modulating pertinent activity in the brain and the immune system. We also document multiple pathways by which stress-induced inflammation harms brain function and ultimately affects mental health, and review how probiotic and prebiotic treatments have shown to be beneficial. Lastly, we provide an overview of gut microbiome-derived compounds (short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan catabolites, microbial pattern recognition) and related mechanisms (vagal nerve activity and fecal microbiota transplants) involved in mediating the influence of the gut microbiome to mental health. Overall, a picture of the gut microbiome playing a facilitating role between stress response, inflammation, and depression, and anxiety is emerging. Future research is needed to firmly establish the microbiome's causal role, to further elucidate the mechanisms by which gut microbes influence brain function and mental health, and to possibly develop treatments that improve mental health through microbiotic targets.\"]},\n",

Migraine, especially with aura, is a risk factor for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Interestingly, stroke risk is highest for migraineurs who are young and otherwise healthy.',\n",
       "   \"Preclinical models have provided us with possible mechanisms to explain the increased vulnerability of migraineurs' brains towards ischemia and suggest a key role for enhanced cerebral excitability and increased incidence of microembolic events. Spreading depolarization (SD), a slowly propagating wave of neuronal depolarization, is the electrophysiologic event underlying migraine aura and a known headache trigger. Increased SD susceptibility has been demonstrated in migraine animal models, including transgenic mice carrying human mutations for the migraine-associated syndrome CADASIL and familial hemiplegic migraine (type 1 and 2). Upon experimentally induced SD, these mice develop aura-like neurological symptoms, akin to patients with the respective mutations. Migraine mutant mice also exhibit an increased frequency of ischemia-triggered SDs upon experimental stroke, associated with accelerated infarct growth and worse outcomes. The severe stroke phenotype can be explained by SD-related downstream events that exacerbate the metabolic mismatch, including pericyte contraction and neuroglial inflammation. Pharmacological suppression of the genetically enhanced SD susceptibility normalizes the stroke phenotype in familial hemiplegic migraine mutant mice. Recent epidemiologic and imaging studies suggest that these preclinical findings can be extrapolated to migraine patients. Migraine patients are at risk for particularly cardioembolic stroke. At the same time, studies suggest an increased incidence of coagulopathy, atrial fibrillation and patent foramen ovale among migraineurs, providing a possible path for microembolic induction of SD and, in rare instances, stroke in hyperexcitable brains. Indeed, recent imaging studies document an accelerated infarct progression with only little potentially salvageable brain tissue in acute stroke patients with a migraine history, suggesting an increased vulnerability towards cerebral ischemia.\",\n",

Although it has long been known that their underlying etiology is venous insufficiency, the molecular aspects of healing versus nonhealing, as well as the psychoneurologic symptoms (PNS; pain, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, depression, and anxiety) associated with CVLUs remain understudied. In this biobehaviorally focused review, we aim to elucidate the complex mechanisms that link the biological and molecular aspects of CLVUs with their PNS. Innovations in \"omics\" research have increased our understanding of important wound microenvironmental factors (e.g., inflammation, microbial pathogenic biofilm, epigenetic processes) that may adversely alter the wound bed\\'s molecular milieu so that microbes evade immune detection. Although these molecular factors are not singularly responsible for wound healing, they are major components of wound development, nonhealing, and PNS that, until now, have not been amenable to systematic study, especially over time. Further, this review explores our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the immune activation that contributes to the development and persistence of CVLUs also leads to the development, persistence, and severity of wound-related PNS. We also make recommendations for future research that will expand the field of biobehavioral wound science. Biobehavioral research that focuses on the interrelated mechanisms of PNS will lead to symptom-management interventions that improve quality of life for the population burdened by CVLUs.']},\n",

A subset of 84 participants who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of hatha yoga vs. health education control provided blood samples at baseline (pre-treatment) and at 3-(during treatment) and 10-week (end of treatment) follow-up visits. To be eligible for the RCT, participants met criteria for a current or recent (past two years) major depressive episode, had current elevated depression symptoms, and current antidepressant medication use. Venous blood was drawn between 2 and 6\\u2009pm and following at least one hour of fasting, and inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP, and TNF-α) were assayed. Effects of participation in yoga relative to health education on inflammatory markers over time were examined with latent growth analyses. We observed a significant reduction in IL-6 concentrations in the yoga treatment group relative to the health education control group as demonstrated by a negative interaction between treatment group and slope of IL-6. TNF-α and CRP did not evidence significant interactions of treatment group by mean slope or intercept. In addition to the benefits of hatha yoga as an adjunctive intervention for individuals who have shown inadequate response to antidepressant medications, our findings point to possible benefits of yoga on IL-6 in depressed populations. Further research is needed to explore the effects of hatha yoga on immune function over time.']},\n",

Our previous work has shown that T-lymphocytes exposed to elevated levels of norepinephrine (NE) displayed a pro-inflammatory signature reminiscent of an autoreactive phenotype. With this, we hypothesized that the increased sympathetic tone observed during psychological trauma may be promoting pro-inflammatory T-lymphocytes, which causes a predisposition to comorbid inflammatory conditions. Here, we examined the consequences of psychological trauma on splenic T-lymphocytes using a mouse model of repeated social defeat stress. Social defeat led to anxiety-like and depression-like behavior as has been previously described. The spleens of socially-defeated mice showed significant elevations of NE, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) levels, which appeared to be due in part to increased expression within T-lymphocytes. Additionally, T-lymphocytes from stressed animals showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial superoxide. Interestingly, in this model system, close associations exist within splenic T-lymphocytes amid the autonomic, inflammatory, and redox environments, but these only weakly correlate with individual behavioral differences among animals suggesting the psychological and physiological manifestations of trauma may not be tightly coupled. Last, we describe, for the first time, elevations in calprotectin levels within T-lymphocytes and in circulation of psychologically stressed animals. Calprotectin correlated with both behavioral and physiological changes after social defeat, suggesting the potential for a new biological marker and/or therapeutic target for psychological trauma and its inflammatory comorbidities.']},\n",

Nevertheless, the possible involvement of activated microglia in this comorbidity has remained unclear. This paper aims to review microglial disturbances in major depression, CFS and their comorbidity. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed / MEDLINE database to identify studies, which are relevant to this current review. Depressed patients present neuroinflammatory alterations, probably related to microglial activation, while animal models show that a microglial response to immune challenges including lipopolysaccharides is accompanied by depressive-like behaviors. Recent evidence from preclinical studies indicates that activated microglia have a key role in the onset of fatigue. In chronic inflammatory conditions, such as infections and senescence, microglia orchestrate an inflammatory microenvironment thereby causing fatigue. In conclusion, based on our review we may posit that shared immune-inflammatory pathways and especially activated microglia underpin comorbid depression and CFS. As such, microglial activation and neuro-inflammation may be promising targets to treat the overlapping manifestations of both depression and CFS.']},\n",

Here we examined whether these biomarkers may aid in the classification of unknown subjects into the target class MDD. The aforementioned biomarkers were assayed in 60 first-episode, drug-naïve depressed patients and 30 controls. We used joint principal component analysis (PCA) performed on all subjects to check whether subjects cluster by classes; support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold validation; and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and SIMCA performed on calibration and validation sets and we computed the figures of merit and learnt from the data. PCA shows that both groups were well separated using the first three PCs, while correlation loadings show that all five biomarkers have discriminatory value. SVM and LDA yielded an accuracy of 100% in validation samples. Using SIMCA, there was a highly significant discrimination of both groups (model-to-model distance = 110.2); all biomarkers showed a significant discrimination and modeling power, while 100% of the patients were authenticated as MDD cases with a specificity of 93.3%. We have delineated that MDD is a distinct class with respect to neuro-immune and opioid biomarkers and that future unknown subjects can be authenticated as having MDD using this SIMCA fingerprint. Precision psychiatry should employ SIMCA to (a) authenticate patients as belonging to the claimed target class and identify other subjects as outsiders, members of another class, or aliens; and (b) acquire knowledge through learning from the data by constructing a biomarker fingerprint of the target class.']},\n",

Common genetic variants associated with multiple psychiatric disorders suggest that shared genetic architecture could contribute to divergent clinical syndromes. To evaluate shared transcriptional alterations across connected brain regions, Affymetrix microarrays were used to profile postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), hippocampus, and associative striatum from 19 well-matched tetrads of subjects with SCZ, BD, MDD, or unaffected controls. SCZ subjects showed a substantial burden of differentially expressed genes across all examined brain regions with the greatest effects in hippocampus, whereas BD and MDD showed less robust alterations. Pathway analysis of transcriptional profiles compared across diagnoses demonstrated commonly enriched pathways between all three disorders in hippocampus, significant overlap between SCZ and BD in DLPFC, but no significant overlap of enriched pathways between disorders in striatum. SCZ samples showed increased expression of transcripts associated with inflammation across all brain regions examined, which was not evident in BD or MDD, or in rat brain following chronic dosing with antipsychotic drugs. Several markers of inflammation were confirmed by RT-PCR in hippocampus, including S100A8/9, IL-6, MAFF, APOLD1, IFITM3, and BAG3. A cytokine ELISA panel showed significant increases in IL-2 and IL-12p70 protein content in hippocampal tissue collected from same SCZ subjects when compared to matched control subjects. These data suggest an overlapping subset of dysregulated pathways across psychiatric disorders; however, a widespread increase in inflammation appears to be a specific feature of the SCZ brain and is not likely to be attributable to chronic antipsychotic drug treatment.']},\n",

Data from the literature suggest that women experience a doubled incidence of CVD related deaths, while angina, heart failure and stroke are increasingly prevalent in females. About 20-25% of women go through depression during their life, and depressive symptoms have been considered a relevant emergent, non-traditional risk factor for CVD in this part of the general population. Underlying mechanisms explaining the link between depression and CVD may range from behavioral to biological risk factors, including sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity and impairment in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. However, the neuroendocrine-driven background could only partially explain the differences mentioned above for chronic systemic inflammation, altered hemostasis and modulation of cardiac autonomic control. In addition, some evidence also suggests the existence of gender-specific differences in biological responses to mental stress. Given these premises, we here summarize the current knowledge about depression and CVD relationship in women, highlighting the sex differences in physiopathology, clinical presentation and treatments.']},\n",

However, the precise neurobiology of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests that various inflammatory processes play a key role in depression and schizophrenia, and that anti-inflammatory drugs exert a therapeutic effect in patients with psychiatric disorders. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs) have potent anti-inflammatory properties. These mediators are broken down into their corresponding diols by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), and inhibition of sEH enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of EETs. Therefore, sEH may play a key role in inflammation, which is involved in psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have shown that abnormal levels of sEH may be involved in the pathogenesis of certain psychiatric diseases, and that sEH inhibitors exhibit antidepressant and antipsychotic activity. The present review discusses the extensive evidence supporting sEH as a therapeutic target for psychiatric diseases, and the clinical value of sEH inhibitors as therapeutic or prophylactic drugs.']},\n",

Moreover, we studied possible mediators for these associations, including physical activity, metabolic markers and childhood trauma. From 240 individuals evaluated at baseline, 73 were re-evaluated in the follow-up. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed with the K-SADS or the MINI and child trauma questionnaire (CTQ) to evaluate presence of trauma. We searched serum levels of IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α (flow cytometry), BDNF (sandwich-ELISA) and carbonyl content in proteins (PCC method). We found a significant direct association between ADs at baseline and log IL-6 (B\\u202f=\\u202f0.34, S.E.\\u202f=\\u202f0.11, p\\u202f=\\u202f0.002) and between AD and log BDNF (B\\u202f=\\u202f-0.10, S.E.\\u202f=\\u202f0.05, p\\u202f=\\u202f0.033) five years later. Searching for possible mediators of these association, we found that levels of HDL-cholesterol (ΔB\\u202f=\\u202f-0.148) partially mediated the association between ADs and IL-6. No significant mediators were found in the association between ADs and BDNF. Moreover, this association is no longer significant after controlling for the presence of depression. Our results demonstrated that previous AD diagnosis was associated with higher levels of IL-6 in the follow-up evaluation, suggesting that the presence of anxiety in childhood could influence altered inflammatory markers.']},\n",

Inflammation and cardiometabolic dysfunction are likely mechanistic candidates for increased depression risk, and their prevalence differs by sex. Whether these relationships extend to depressive symptoms is poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed sex in associations between inflammation and metabolic syndrome (MetS) criteria on depressive symptomatology. Specifically, we examined whether sex positively moderates the relationship between depressive symptoms and inflammation among women, and whether MetS has parallel effects among men.',\n",
       "   'Depressive symptoms, MetS, and inflammation were assessed in 129 otherwise healthy adults. Depressive symptoms were assessed using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-Ia). Monocyte inflammation regulation (BARIC) was quantified using flow cytometry measurement of TNF-α suppression by β-agonist. Moderation effects of sex on associations between BARIC, MetS criteria, and BDI were estimated using two-way ANOVA and linear regression, adjusting for BMI, and by sex subgroup analyses.',\n",

Sex did not formally moderate this relationship, though BDI scores tended to differ by BMI among women, but not men, in subgroup analysis. Poorer inflammation control and higher MetS criteria were correlated with somatic depressive symptoms. Sex moderated associations between MetS criteria and somatic symptoms; among men, MetS criteria predicted somatic symptoms, not among women. Subgroup analysis further indicated that poorer inflammation control tended to be associated with higher somatic symptoms in women.',\n",

Although pathophysiological mechanisms underlying sex differences remain to be elucidated, our findings suggest that distinct vulnerabilities to depressive symptoms exist between women and men, and highlight the need to consider sex as a key biological variable in obesity-depression relationships.

Up to 50% of patients with type 1 and type 2 DM and suboptimal glycemic control have delayed gastric emptying (GE), which can be documented with scintigraphy, 13C breath tests, or a wireless motility capsule; the remainder have normal or rapid GE. Many patients with delayed GE are asymptomatic; others have dyspepsia (i.e., mild to moderate indigestion, with or without a mild delay in GE) or gastroparesis, which is a syndrome characterized by moderate to severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms and delayed GE that suggest, but are not accompanied by, gastric outlet obstruction. Gastroparesis can markedly impair quality of life, and up to 50% of patients have significant anxiety and/or depression. Often the distinction between dyspepsia and gastroparesis is based on clinical judgement rather than established criteria. Hyperglycemia, autonomic neuropathy, and enteric neuromuscular inflammation and injury are implicated in the pathogenesis of delayed GE. Alternatively, there are limited data to suggest that delayed GE may affect glycemic control. The management of diabetic gastroparesis is guided by the severity of symptoms, the magnitude of delayed GE, and the nutritional status. Initial options include dietary modifications, supplemental oral nutrition, and antiemetic and prokinetic medications. Patients with more severe symptoms may require a venting gastrostomy or jejunostomy and/or gastric electrical stimulation. Promising newer therapeutic approaches include ghrelin receptor agonists and selective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists.']},\n",

Microglia-mediated inflammation has been linked to psychopathology, so such inflammation may be a target for treating depression. Using a model of depression involving adolescent male C57BL/6J mice subjected to maternal separation, we explored whether using minocycline to mitigate inflammation can alleviate depression-like behaviors. Between postnatal days 1 and 14, male mice were separated from their mothers for 3\\u2009h per day. Minocycline (20\\u2009mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally once daily for 2 weeks starting one week after weaning. Then the male mice were subjected to a second stress for 2 weeks. Results from the sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and open field test showed that maternal separation did not obviously alter behavior of the male mice, but it did increase the risk of depression-like behaviors following a second stress. This increased risk disappeared if minocycline was given preemptively before the second stress. Maternal separation and second stress up-regulated pro-inflammatory markers and down-regulated anti-inflammatory markers in the hippocampus, and they activated microglia and promoted pro-inflammatory transitions in microglia. All these effects were reversed by minocycline. These changes in inflammatory processes correlated with changes in neurogenesis and BDNF expression in the hippocampus. Our results in this mouse model suggest the potential of minocycline for treating psychiatric disorders induced by early adversity.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous disease involving widespread disruptions in functional brain networks, the neurobiological mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Amassing evidence supports innate immune activation as one pathophysiologic mechanism contributing to depression in a subgroup of patients with elevated inflammatory markers. Although inflammation is known to alter monoamine and glutamate neurotransmitters, little work has been done to understand its role in network dysfunction in patients with depression. Here we conducted a large-scale network-based analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) data acquired from depressed patients with varying levels of inflammation to develop a comprehensive characterization of network alterations as an effect of inflammation. Complementary approaches of global brain connectivity and parcellation-based network analysis applied to the whole brain revealed that increased plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) was associated with reduced functional connectivity in a widely-distributed network including ventral striatum, parahippocampal gyrus/amygdala, orbitofrontal and insular cortices, and posterior cingulate cortex. These broad alterations were centralized in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), representing a hub for the effects of inflammation on network function in the whole brain. When feeding the identified multivariate network features into a machine learning algorithm of support vector regression, we achieved high prediction accuracies for depressive symptoms that have been associated with inflammation in previous studies including anhedonia and motor slowing. These findings extend and broaden previous observations from hypothesis-driven studies, providing further support for inflammation as a distinct contributing factor to network dysfunction and symptom severity in depression.']},\n",

We hypothesized that depression would have negative effects on inflammation and wound healing and that antidepressant therapy would reverse these effects. This study included 100 rats randomly allocated into five groups: control group (CG), depression group (DG), pre-depression group (PDG), antidepressant group (AG), and pre-antidepressant group (PAG). Acute wounds were created on the rats' backs. The groups were subjected to no interventions (CG), aversive stimuli before (PDG) and after (DG) wound creation, and antidepressant treatment before (PAG) and after (AG) wound creation. On the day of wound creation and on days 3, 6, 9, and 12 after wound creation, observations of the wound area and degree of depression (evaluated using the sucrose preference test, open-field test, and weight change) were recorded. On days 6 and 12 after wound creation, venous serum and wound tissues were collected. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results showed an initial increase followed by a decrease in the degree of depression in all groups except DG (continuous decline). The wound-healing rate was significantly lower in PDG and DG than in CG; it was higher in AG and PAG than in CG. DG and PDG had higher concentrations of inflammatory cytokines than CG, and AG and PAG had lower concentrations than CG. This indicates that the onset of depression delays the healing of acute wounds and aggravates the inflammatory response in rats. Antidepressant treatment counteracts both of these negative effects.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating condition, whose high prevalence and multisymptomatic nature set its standing as a leading contributor to global disability. To better understand this psychiatric disease, various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed, including changes in monoaminergic neurotransmission, imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the brain, hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and abnormalities in normal neurogenesis. While previous findings led to a deeper understanding of the disease, the pathogenesis of MDD has not yet been elucidated. Accumulating evidence has confirmed the association between chronic inflammation and MDD, which is manifested by increased levels of the C-reactive protein, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin 1 beta, Interleukin 6, and the Tumor necrosis factor alpha. Furthermore, recent findings have implicated a related family of cytokines with chemotactic properties, known collectively as chemokines, in many neuroimmune processes relevant to psychiatric disorders. Chemokines are small (8-12 kDa) chemotactic cytokines, which are known to play roles in direct chemotaxis induction, leukocyte and macrophage migration, and inflammatory response propagation. The inflammatory chemokines possess the ability to induce migration of immune cells to the infection site, whereas their homeostatic chemokine counterparts are responsible for recruiting cells for their repair and maintenance. To further support the role of chemokines as central elements to healthy bodily function, recent studies suggest that these proteins demonstrate novel, brain-specific mechanisms including the modulation of neuroendocrine functions, chemotaxis, cell adhesion, and neuroinflammation. Elevated levels of chemokines in patient-derived serum have been detected in individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, despite the considerable heterogeneity of experimental samples and methodologies, existing biomarker studies have clearly demonstrated the important role of chemokines in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize the data from contemporary experimental and clinical studies, and to evaluate available evidence for the role of chemokines in the central nervous system (CNS) under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In light of recent results, chemokines could be considered as possible peripheral markers of psychiatric disorders, and/or targets for treating depressive disorders.']},\n",

Hepatocyte apoptosis and inflammation are identified as the hallmarks of liver I/R injury. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is induced following hypoxia or ischemic stimulation, and exerts the contradictory roles in various injury progression. However, its role and mechanism lying beneath hepatic I/R remains ill defined. In this study, elevation of MALAT1 expression was corroborated in human hepatocytes under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)H/R condition. Of interest, depression of MALAT1 blunted H/R-inhibited cell viability, and counteracted lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde release. Additionally, MALAT1 cessation antagonized H/R-evoked cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. Simultaneously, the increased inflammatory reaction triggered by H/R stimulation was also abrogated following MALAT1 suppression by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts and productions including IL-1β and TNF-α. Mechanistically, H/R exposure activated the pathway of high-mobility group box1 (HMGB1)-TLR4, which was muted after MALAT1 inhibition. More importantly, elevation of HMGB1 reversed MALAT1 down-regulation-mediated inhibition in cell injury and inflammation. Moreover, blocking the TLR4 signaling also ameliorated H/R-evoked hepatocyte apoptosis and inflammatory response. Consequently, these data suggest that MALAT1 may aggravate hepatic I/R injury by regulating the HMGB1-TLR4-triggered cell apoptosis and inflammation, implying a promising therapeutic strategy to fight liver I/R injury.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Each year approximately 1.7 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the US alone. Associated with these head injuries is a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms including irritability, depression, and anxiety. Neuroinflammation, due in part to microglia, can worsen or even cause neuropsychiatric disorders after TBI. For example, mounting evidence demonstrates that microglia become \"primed\" or hyper-reactive with an exaggerated pro-inflammatory phenotype following multiple immune challenges. Microglial priming occurs after experimental TBI and correlates with the emergence of depressive-like behavior as well as cognitive dysfunction. Critically, immune challenges are various and include illness, aging, and stress. The collective influence of any combination of these immune challenges shapes the neuroimmune environment and the response to TBI. For example, stress reliably induces inflammation and could therefore be a gateway to altered neuropathology and behavioral decline following TBI. Given the increasing incidence of stress-related psychiatric disorders after TBI, the degree in which stress affects outcome is of particular interest. This review aims to highlight the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as a key mediator of stress-immune pathway communication following TBI. We will first describe maladaptive neuroinflammation after TBI and how stress contributes to inflammation through both anti- and pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Clinical and experimental data describing HPA-axis dysfunction and consequences of altered stress responses after TBI will be discussed. Lastly, we will review common stress models used after TBI that could better elucidate the relationship between HPA axis dysfunction and maladaptive inflammation following TBI. Together, the studies described in this review suggest that HPA axis dysfunction after brain injury is prevalent and contributes to the dynamic nature of the neuroinflammatory response to brain injury. Experimental stressors that directly engage the HPA axis represent important areas for future research to better define the role of stress-immune pathways in mediating outcome following TBI.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Depression is among the most significant public mental health issues. A growing body of research implicates inflammation in the etiology and pathophysiology of depression. Yet, the results are somewhat inconsistent, leading to burgeoning attempts to identify associations between components of innate immune system involved in inflammation and specific symptoms of depression, including attention to emotional information. Negative attentional bias, defined as a tendency to direct attention toward negatively valenced information, is one of the core cognitive features of depression and is reliably demonstrated in depressed and vulnerable individuals. Altered attentional processing of emotional information and immunological changes are often precipitated by stressful events. Psychological stress triggers inflammatory activity and affective-cognitive changes that play a critical role in the onset, maintenance, and recurrence of depression. Using various designs, recent studies have reported a positive relationship between markers of inflammation and negative attentional bias on behavioral and neural levels, suggesting that the association between inflammation and emotional attention might represent a neurobiological pathway linking stress and depression. This mini-review summarizes current research on the reciprocal relationships between different types of stressors, emotional attention, inflammation, and depression, and discusses potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying these interactions. The integration provided aims to contribute toward understanding how biological and psychological processes interact to influence depression outcomes.']},\n",

Recent studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effect of baicalin is linked to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which participates in pathological changes of central nervous system diseases such as depression. In this study, we explored whether baicalin could produce antidepressant effects via regulation of TLR4 signaling in mice and attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.',\n",
       "   'A chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice model was performed to explore whether baicalin could produce antidepressant effects via the inhibition of neuroinflammation. To clarify the role of TLR4 in the anti-neuroinflammatory efficacy of baicalin, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was employed in mice to specially activate TLR4 and the behavioral changes were determined. Furthermore, we used LY294002 to examine the molecular mechanisms of baicalin in regulating the expression of TLR4 in vivo and in vitro using western blot, ELISA kits, and immunostaining. In the in vitro tests, the BV2 microglia cell lines and primary microglia cultures were pretreated with baicalin and LY292002 for 1\\u2009h and then stimulated 24\\u2009h with LPS. The primary microglial cells were transfected with the forkhead transcription factor forkhead box protein O 1 (FoxO1)-specific siRNA for 5\\u2009h and then co-stimulated with baicalin and LPS to investigate whether FoxO1 participated in the effect of baicalin on TLR4 expression.',\n",
       "   'The administration of baicalin (especially 60\\u2009mg/kg) dramatically ameliorated CUMS-induced depressive-like symptoms; substantially decreased the levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the hippocampus; and significantly decreased the expression of TLR4. The activation of TLR4 by the LPS triggered neuroinflammation and evoked depressive-like behaviors in mice, which were also alleviated by the treatment with baicalin (60\\u2009mg/kg). Furthermore, the application of baicalin significantly increased the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and FoxO1. The application of baicalin also promoted FoxO1 nuclear exclusion and contributed to the inhibition of the FoxO1 transactivation potential, which led to the downregulation of the expression of TLR4 in CUMS mice or LPS-treated BV2 cells and primary microglia cells. However, prophylactic treatment of LY294002 abolished the above effects of baicalin. In addition, we found that FoxO1 played a vital role in baicalin by regulating the TLR4 and TLR4-mediating neuroinflammation triggered by the LPS via knocking down the expression of FoxO1 in the primary microglia.',\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Interferon (IFN)-alpha, until recently the standard treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, is associated with a significant risk of major depressive episode (MDE, or IFN-alpha-induced depression). However, it is little studied the comparisons of clinical manifestations between IFN-alpha-induced depression and major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition, IFN-alpha induces different neuroinflammation and neuroendocrine status throughput the HCV treatment course; however, the clinical presentations have never been compared between early-onset and later-onset IFN-alpha-induced depression. We assessed 200 HCV patients starting IFN-alpha therapy bi-weekly for 24\\u202fweeks, with the structured interview for confirmation of diagnosis of IFN-alpha-induced depression and with clinical rating scales for depressive symptoms and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Subjects developed IFN-alpha-induced depression (n\\u202f=\\u202f59, 30%) during the first 6\\u202fweeks of IFN-alpha therapy were defined as the early-onset group (n\\u202f=\\u202f32), while those developed depression after the 6th week were defined as the late-onset group (n\\u202f=\\u202f27). A matched group of MDD patients (n\\u202f=\\u202f60) was used to compare specific clusters of depressive symptoms with early- and late-onset IFN-alpha-induced depression. Compared to the matched group of MDD patients, IFN-alpha-induced depression was significantly associated with more somatic symptoms and fewer symptoms of mood, anxiety and negative cognition. More somatic symptoms were also found in those who became clinically depressed at early stage of IFN-alpha therapy. We suggest that the specific somatic features of interferon-alpha-induced depression, and especially of early-onset depression, characterise individuals who are more sensitive to cytokines-induced changes in mood.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) is greatly attributed to the pancreatic acinar cell (PAC) death response. It has been established that the apoptosis-inducing therapy can protect against experimental pancreatitis and have great clinical therapeutic potential. However, current pharmacologic agents that target apoptosis during AP largely lack specificity. Thus, it remains imperative to reveal the specific mechanisms governing acinar cell death. Death responses of PAC are manifested by the progressive necrosis accompanied by apoptosis silencing during AP in mice. In this study, we found that the transcriptional activity of p53 was impaired and the expressions of its proapoptotic targets Puma and CD95 were significantly decreased, which explains the apoptosis silencing during AP. Furthermore, we found that the functional depression of p53 was resulted from histone deacetylase (HDAC)-mediated deacetylation of p53 C-terminal in PAC during AP. Treatment of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin-A restored p53 apoptosis pathway, resulted in a necrosis/apoptosis switch and protected mice from cerulein- or l-Arg-induced AP. Our research identified the HDAC-dependent regulation of p53 activity as a critical mechanism underlying acinar cell death response, which represents a specific target for the treatment of AP.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by cerebrovascular pathology and more likely to suffer from premature cognitive decline. Depression is a risk factor for poorer cognitive functioning, and research is needed to identify factors that serve to mitigate its negative effects. Studies have demonstrated positive influences of spirituality within the AA community. Determining whether spirituality attenuates the effects of depressive symptoms on cognitive functioning and the pathophysiological mechanisms that explain these relationships in AAs is paramount. This study examines the influence of daily spiritual experiences on the relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning, and how inflammatory markers may partially explain these associations. A sample of 212 (mean age= 45.6) participants completed the Daily Spiritual Experience Scale (DSES), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Trail Making Test A and B (TMT) and Stroop Color and Word Test (Stroop). Blood samples were collected to measure inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-1a, TNF-a). Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate associations. Higher BDI-II scores were associated with poorer psychomotor speed and visual scanning, measured by TMT A (B=1.49, P=.01). IL-6 explained a significant amount of variance in this relationship (B=.24, CI 95% [.00, .64]). IL-6 also significantly mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and psychomotor speed and mental flexibility, measured by TMT B performance (B=.03, CI 95% [.003, .095]). Frequent spiritual experiences among AAs may ameliorate the negative influence of depressive symptoms on cognitive functioning.']},\n",

Evidence of OS is found during acute relapses, in active inflammatory lesions, and in chronic, longstanding plaques. OS results in both ongoing inflammation and neurodegeneration. Antioxidant therapies are a rational strategy for people with MS with all phenotypes and disease durations. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To understand the function of OS in health and disease, to examine the contributions of OS to MS pathophysiology, and to review current evidence for the effects of selected antioxidant therapies in people with MS (PwMS) with a focus on lipoic acid (LA). RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of antioxidant interventions in both animal and in vivo models result in reductions in serum markers of OS and increases in levels and activity of antioxidant enzymes. Antioxidant trials in PwMS, while generally underpowered, detect short-term improvements in markers of OS and antioxidant defenses, and to a lesser extent, in clinical symptoms (fatigue, depression). The best evidence to date is a 2-year trial of LA in secondary progressive MS which demonstrated a significant reduction of whole-brain atrophy and trend toward improvement in walking speed. Antioxidant therapy is a promising approach to treat MS across the spectrum and duration of disease. Rigorous and well-powered trials are needed to determine their therapeutic benefits.']},\n",

We analyzed the effects of DEX on the expression of estrogen metabolism enzyme 17β-HSD1 at the optic nerve. Rats were treated with different concentrations of intraperitoneal DEX.

The enzyme was detected by immunohistochemistry on the terminal foot of Muller cells from the ganglion cell layer of rat retina. ELISA analysis showed that the 17β-HSD1 protein expression of DEX-treated group is 2.4 fold comparing to the control group. The results indicated that DMXS sodium phosphate might modulate the expression of 17β-HSD1 protein in optic tissue. This study sheds light on understanding of the relationship among DEX, 17β-HSD presence and distribution of visual neural systems. At the same time, DEX treatment affects the athletic ability and memory of the animals.

Omega-3 PUFAs play essential roles in cell signaling and in the cell structure and fluidity of membranes. They participate in the resolution of inflammation and have anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects. Additionally, they can act as agonists of G protein-coupled receptors, namely, GPR40/FFA1 and GPR120/FFA4. Cancer patients undergo complications, such as anorexia-cachexia syndrome, pain, depression, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Interestingly, the 2017 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines for cancer patients only discuss the use of omega-3 PUFAs for cancer-cachexia treatment, leaving aside other cancer-related complications that could potentially be managed by omega-3 PUFA supplementation. This critical review aimed to discuss the effects and the possible underlying mechanisms of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in cancer-related complications. Data compilation in this critical review indicates that further investigation is still required to assess the factual benefits of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in cancer-associated illnesses. Nevertheless, preclinical evidence reveals that omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites might modulate pivotal pathways underlying complications secondary to cancer, indicating that this is a promising field of knowledge to be explored.']},\n",

Current treatments for MDD are unsatisfactory given high non-response rates, high relapse rates, and undesirable side effects. Accumulating evidence suggests that Tai Chi, a popular mind-body intervention that originated as a martial art, can significantly regulate emotion and relieve the symptoms of mood disorders. In addition, the availability of instructional videos and the development of more simplified and less structured Tai Chi has made it a promising low-intensity mind-body exercise. In this article, we first examine a number of clinical trials that implemented Tai Chi as a treatment for depression. Then, we explore several mechanisms by which Tai Chi may alleviate depressive symptoms, hypothesizing that the intervention may modulate the activity and connectivity of key brain regions involved in mood regulation, reduce neuro-inflammatory sensitization, modulate the autonomic nervous system, and regulate hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, we discuss common challenges of the intervention and possible ways to address them. Specifically, we pose developing a simplified and tailored Tai Chi protocol for patients with depression, comparatively investigating Tai Chi with other mind-body interventions such as yoga and Baduanjin, and developing new mind-body interventions that merge the advantages of multiple mind-body exercises.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"The discovery that prolonged administration of interferon-alpha (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) readily precipitates depressive symptoms has played a key role in development of the inflammation theory of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it remains unclear whether the clinical phenotype of patients with inflammation-associated depression significantly overlaps with, or can be distinguished from that of patients with 'idiopathic' depression. Here we explored the Hamilton depression scale factor structure of 172 patients undergoing interferon-alpha treatment for hepatitis-C at the point of transition to a depressive episode of DSM IV defined major depression severity. The resulting factor structure was first compared with a model derived from 6 previous studies of 'idiopathic' MDD (Cole et al., 2004). This confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of HAMD scores in our interferon-alpha treated cohort did not plausibly fit that previously described for 'idiopathic' MDD. Instead, subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed a distinct four factor model with a novel primary factor grouping cognitive symptoms of depression and anxiety (HAMD items 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 15). The second sleep disorder factor (items 4, 5, 6) replicated previous findings in 'idiopathic' depression. A third and unique factor grouped somatic symptoms and function (items 7, 12, 13, 14 and item 1). The final factor (also common in idiopathic depression studies), grouped gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss (items 12 and 16). Severe depression items (3, 8, and 17) were excluded from analysis due to very low variance. At transition, interferon-alpha induced major depressive episodes therefore appears to have more associated anxiety features that covary with depressed mood than classical or 'idiopathic' MDD and a low likelihood of severe features such as suicidal ideation. Identification of this clinical phenotype may help identify patients with an inflammatory depression etiology and support the development of more effective and personalized therapies.\"]},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Growing evidence has implicated that myelin deficits and neuroinflammation are the coexisted pathological features that contribute to the mood swing and cognitive decline in major depressive disorder (MDD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, attenuation of neuroinflammation and reduction of demyelination became newly emerging treatment strategies for the mood and cognitive symptoms. Antidepressant venlafaxine has been used in depression and anxiety through its multiple neuroprotective effects. However, it is unclear whether venlafaxine can improve myelin integrity and alter inflammation status in the brain. By using a well-established cuprizone-induced acute mouse model of demyelination, we investigated the protective effects of venlafaxine on these facets. The cuprizone-fed animals exhibited cognitive impairment and mood disturbances together with myelin loss and prominent neuroinflammation in the brain. Our present study showed that a high dose of venlafaxine alleviated the loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes (OLs), mitigated depression-like behaviors, and improved cognitive function in cuprizone-fed animals. Data from the present study also showed that venlafaxine reduced microglia-mediated inflammation in the brains of cuprizone-fed animals. These findings suggest that venlafaxine may exert its therapeutic effects ']},\n",

Interestingly, increasing numbers of evidence show the therapeutic benefits of mitochondria transfer. Therefore, we hypothesized that injection of exogenous mitochondria would contribute to ameliorate depressive-like symptoms. In this study, the antidepressant-like effect of intravenous isolated mitochondria was evaluated on a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- induced model of depression. The depressive-like behaviors were assessed using forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and sucrose preference test. Besides, the neurogenesis, expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial activation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and ATP production were determined in the hippocampus. The results showed that treatment of isolated mitochondria decreased the immobility time of mice in the FST and TST, and attenuated the decrease in sucrose preference test. Moreover, isolated mitochondria significantly reduced the activation of astrocyte and microglia as well as neuroinflammation (i.e. 1\\u202fL-1β, TNF-α and COX-2), increased BDNF expression and neurogenesis, restored the dysfunction of ATP production and oxidative stress in inflammation- induced depression.

While depression alone is disabling, patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments, poorer clinical recovery, and reduced quality of life. Consequently, it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD. Areas covered: This review spans psychological, physical, and pharmacological treatment approaches for cognitive dysfunction in depression. Where possible, the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains (e.g., attention), and highlight the differential mechanisms which underpin cognitive improvement. In addition, the roles of adjunctive cognitive treatments (e.g., exercise), and the possible side effects and drawbacks of specific treatments are explored. Expert opinion: Psychological treatments typically confer cognitive improvement alongside functional and/or clinical recovery; however, the efficacy of cognitive training and cognitive behavioral therapy to longitudinal cognitive improvement remains to be established. Recently developed pharmacological agents may improve cognition by reducing low-grade inflammation and promoting neurogenesis; however, the pro-cognitive effects of typical antidepressants are limited. Integrated approaches which emphasize cognitive recovery alongside clinical and functional improvement may be key to advancing patient outcomes.']},\n",

PS is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and depression, and 30% of PS patients are affected with psoriatic arthritis. PS presents excessive keratinocyte proliferation, abnormal differentiation, and elevated mast cell (MC) number. In PS, there are enhanced type I interferon (IFN), angiogenesis, and over-expression of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-1 family members generated by several immune cells including MCs. MCs are hematopoietic cells that reside in vascularized tissues, which, upon appropriate activation, release proinflammatory cytokines, an effect worsened by acute stress and PS. In recent years, IL-37 emerged as an anti-inflammatory cytokine which binds to alpha chain of the IL-18 receptor alpha (IL-18Rα) and downregulates MyD88. This effect leads to the inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen activation protein kinase, with the suppression of inflammatory response.

Combined treatment with the probiotic strains Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus helveticus in rats has been shown to attenuate caspase-3 activation and depressive-like behaviour together with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The present study was designed to determine the respective contribution of these two strains on caspase-3 activity in the limbic system and on depressive-like behaviour. Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four groups: Vehicle, L. helveticus R0052, B. longum R0175 and L. salivarius HA-118, administered orally for 14 days (109CFU daily) before inducing MI by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery for 40 min followed by 14 days of reperfusion. Animals were then tested for socialisation, passive avoidance and forced swim test to assess depressive-like behaviour. At day 18 the animals were sacrificed; infarct size was estimated, plasma C-reactive protein concentration and brain caspase-3 activity were measured. Results indicated that infarct size did not vary across the different treatments. Rats treated with B. longum spent more time socializing, learned more rapidly the passive avoidance test and spent less time immobile in the forced swim test compared to the vehicle groups. Caspase-3 activity and plasma C-reactive protein concentrations were reduced in the lateral and medial amygdala as well as in the dentate gyrus of B. longum-supplemented animals. The only significant effect in the two groups receiving Lactobacilli compared to vehicle was that rats receiving L. salivarius learned more rapidly in the step-down passive avoidance test. In conclusion, most of the beneficial effects that we previously reported with the combination of two probiotic strains in our experimentation regarding post-myocardial infarction depression are related to Bifidobacterium longum.']},\n",

Intriguingly, inflammation and RAS can activate each other, forming a positive feedback loop that would result in exacerbated unwanted tissue damage. To further examine the interrelationship among insulin signaling, neuroinflammation and RAS in the brain, the effect of repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and co-treatment with the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor type 1 (AT1) blocker, candesartan (Cand), on anxiety and depression-like behaviors, RAS, neuroinflammation and insulin signaling was explored. Our results demonstrated that prolonged LPS challenge successfully induced the rats into anxiety and depression-like state, accompanied with significant neural apoptosis and neuroinflammation. LPS also activated RAS as evidenced by the enhanced angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) expression, Ang II generation and AT1 expression. However, blocking the activated RAS with Cand co-treatment conferred neurobehavioral protective properties. The AT1 blocker markedly ameliorated the microglial activation, the enhanced gene expression of the proinflammatory cytokines and the overactivated NF-κB signaling. In addition, Cand also mitigated the LPS-induced disturbance of insulin signaling with the normalized phosphorylation of serine 307 and tyrosine 896 of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Collectively, the present study, for the first time, provided the direct evidence indicating that the inflammatory condition may interact with RAS to impede brain insulin pathway, resulting in neurobehavioral damage, and inhibiting RAS seems to be a promising strategy to block the cross-talk and cut off the vicious cycle between RAS and immune system.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. After the first episode, patients with remitted MDD have a 60% chance of experiencing a second episode. Consideration of therapy continuation should be viewed in terms of the balance between the adverse effects of medication and the need to prevent a possible relapse. Relapse during the early stages of MDD could be prevented more efficiently by conducting individual risk assessments and providing justification for continuing therapy. Our previous work established the neuroimaging markers of relapse by comparing patients with recurrent major depressive disorder (rMDD) in depressive and remitted states. However, it is not known which of these markers are trait markers that present before initial relapse and, consequently, predict disease course. Here, we first describe how inflammation can be translated to subtype-specific clinical features and suggest how this could be used to facilitate clinical diagnosis and treatment. Next, we address the central and peripheral functional state of the immune system in patients with MDD. In addition, we emphasize the important link between the number of depressive episodes and rMDD and use neuroimaging to propose a model for the latter. Last, we address how inflammation can affect brain circuits, providing a possible mechanism for rMDD. Our review suggests a link between inflammatory processes and brain region/circuits in rMDD.']},\n",

The aim of our study was to explore the in vivo and in vitro effects of irisin using an LPS-induced septic cardiomyopathy model. Our results demonstrated that irisin treatment attenuated LPS-mediated cardiomyocyte death and myocardial dysfunction. At the molecular level, LPS application was associated with mitochondrial oxidative injury, cardiomyocyte ATP depletion and caspase-related apoptosis activation. In contrast, the irisin treatment sustained mitochondrial function by inhibiting DRP1-related mitochondrial fission and the reactivation of mitochondrial fission impaired the protective action of irisin on inflammation-attacked mitochondria and cardiomyocytes. Additionally, we found that irisin modulated DRP1-related mitochondrial fission through the JNK-LATS2 signaling pathway. JNK activation and/or LATS2 overexpression abolished the beneficial effects of irisin on LPS-mediated mitochondrial stress and cardiomyocyte death. Altogether, our results illustrate that LPS-mediated activation of DRP1-related mitochondrial fission through the JNK-LATS2 pathway participates in the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy. Irisin could be used in the future as an effective therapy for sepsis-induced myocardial depression because it corrects DRP1-related mitochondrial fission and normalizes the JNK-LATS2 signaling pathway.']},\n",

Our cognitive and social abilities rely on a highly sensitive and fine-tuned equilibrium of immune responses that involve both innate and adaptive immunity. Autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, infection and psychosocial stress can tip the scales towards disruption of higher-order networks. However, not only classical neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and autoimmune encephalitis, are caused by immune dysregulation that affects CNS function. Recent insight indicates that similar processes are involved in psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder and depression. Pathways that are common to these disorders include microglial activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, molecular mimicry, anti-neuronal autoantibodies, self-reactive T cells and disturbance of the blood-brain barrier. These discoveries challenge our traditional classification of neurological and psychiatric diseases. New clinical paths are required to identify subgroups of neuropsychiatric disorders that are phenotypically distinct but pathogenically related and to pave the way for mechanism-based immune treatments. Combined expertise from neurologists and psychiatrists will foster translation of these paths into clinical practice. The aim of this Review is to highlight outstanding findings that have transformed our understanding of neuropsychiatric diseases and to suggest new diagnostic and therapeutic criteria for the emerging field of immunoneuropsychiatry.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['The kynurenine pathway (KP) plays a critical role in generating cellular energy in the form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Because energy requirements are substantially increased during an immune response, the KP is a key regulator of the immune system. Perhaps more importantly in the context of psychiatry, many kynurenines are neuroactive, modulating neuroplasticity and/or exerting neurotoxic effects in part through their effects on NMDA receptor signaling and glutamatergic neurotransmission. As such, it is not surprising that the kynurenines have been implicated in psychiatric illness in the context of inflammation. However, because of their neuromodulatory properties, the kynurenines are not just additional members of a list of inflammatory mediators linked with psychiatric illness, but in preclinical studies have been shown to be necessary components of the behavioral analogs of depression and schizophrenia-like cognitive deficits. Further, as the title suggests, the KP is regulated by, and in turn regulates multiple other physiological systems that are commonly disrupted in psychiatric disorders, including endocrine, metabolic, and hormonal systems. This review provides a broad overview of the mechanistic pathways through which the kynurenines interact with these systems, thus impacting emotion, cognition, pain, metabolic function, and aging, and in so doing potentially increasing the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting the KP are discussed. Moreover, electroconvulsive therapy, ketamine, physical exercise, and certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatories have been shown to alter kynurenine metabolism, raising the possibility that kynurenine metabolites may have utility as treatment response or therapeutic monitoring biomarkers.']},\n",

To explore new translational opportunities in developing digital therapeutics for neurological disorders, and their integration with pharmacotherapies, we examined analgesic and antiseizure effects of specific musical compositions in mouse models of pain and epilepsy. The music playlist was created based on the modular progression of Mozart compositions for which reduction of seizures and epileptiform discharges were previously reported in people with epilepsy. Our results indicated that music-treated mice exhibited significant analgesia and reduction of paw edema in the carrageenan model of inflammatory pain. Among analgesic drugs tested (ibuprofen, cannabidiol (CBD), levetiracetam, and the galanin analog NAX 5055), music intervention significantly decreased paw withdrawal latency difference in ibuprofen-treated mice and reduced paw edema in combination with CBD or NAX 5055. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first animal study on music-enhanced antinociceptive activity of analgesic drugs. In the plantar incision model of surgical pain, music-pretreated mice had significant reduction of mechanical allodynia. In the corneal kindling model of epilepsy, the cumulative seizure burden following kindling acquisition was lower in animals exposed to music. The music-treated group also exhibited significantly improved survival, warranting further research on music interventions for preventing Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). We propose a working model of how musical elements such as rhythm, sequences, phrases and punctuation found in K.448 and K.545 may exert responses via parasympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Based on our findings, we discuss: (1) how enriched environment (EE) can serve as a preclinical surrogate for testing combinations of non-pharmacological modalities and drugs for the treatment of pain and other chronic diseases, and (2) a new paradigm for preclinical and clinical development of therapies leading to drug-device combination products for neurological disorders, depression and cancer.

In this study, we examined the effects of the standardised methanol extract of F. platyphylla stem bark (FP) on two-way active avoidance learning and body core temperature to complement earlier studies on the neuroleptic potential of this medicinal plant, which is already in common use. The extract did not interfere with the acquisition and consolidation of the conditioned avoidance reaction (CAR), but did diminish the retrieval of CAR. The extract dose-dependently reduced body core temperature; this was significantly ameliorated by the use of amphetamine. The results confirmed the neuroleptic-like efficacy of FP, probably via the modulation of dopaminergic neurons.\"]},\n",

However, it is unclear whether CHF causes depression, and the underlying mechanisms of this association remain largely unknown. In this study, mice with myocardial infarction and CHF were used to investigate behavioral alterations as well as changes in the brain-heart axis. During the first 6\\xa0months, abnormalities in neuropsychiatric behaviors were detected in mice with CHF. Using the sucrose preference test, a 9\\xa0months course of CHF resulted in two subgroups: mice with a significant decrease in sucrose preference, defined herein as \"susceptible\" (Sus), and mice with a normal sucrose preference, defined herein as \"resilient.\" Compared to the resilient and sham-operated animals, the Sus mice displayed imbalances in glutamate transmission and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, abnormal synaptic plasticity, and increased inflammatory responses. Furthermore, abnormal kynurenine metabolism was detected in Sus mice. Our results suggest that long-term CHF increases inflammatory responses in the central nervous system and leads to depression in Sus mice.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Depression is a condition with a complex etiological pattern, whose effective treatments are highly limited. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been investigated in intensive studies owing to their involvement in pathophysiology of mood disorders. The current study aimed to elucidate the role of miR-301b in hippocampus in mouse models of depressive-like behavior. Microarray-based prediction identified the differentially expressed gene neuronal pentraxin II (NPTX2) related to mental depression. Next, the putative miR-301b binding sites on the 3'UTR of NPTX2 were verified. Then the effect of miR-301b on cognitive function of mice with depressive-like behavior was analyzed using the Morris water maze test. In addition, the regulation of miR-301b to NPTX2 and activation of NF-κB signaling pathway was assessed. Following that, the microglia activation and inflammation in hippocampus were evaluated, with the expressions of inflammatory factors being examined. At last, microglia were flow cytometrically sorted and the inflammatory reaction was also assessed in vitro. The obtained findings revealed that miR-301b targeted and negatively regulated NPTX2. Moreover, overexpressed miR-301b activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, as reflected by increasing protein expressions of p-NF-κB. Upregulated miR-301b accelerated cognitive impairment in mice with depressive-like behavior. In addition, overexpression of miR-301b activated microglia and stimulated inflammation in hippocampus, accompanied by enhanced release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-Iβ (IL-Iβ) and cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2). Taken together, the evidence provided by the current study indicated that overexpression of miR-301b augmented hippocampal microglia activation, thus exacerbating cognitive impairment and inflammation in mice with depressive-like behavior by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.\"]},\n",

Physical conditions are known to influence neurotransmitter precursor amino acids, changes in which are associated with depressive symptoms. In this prospective study we investigated neurotransmitter precursor amino acids levels in patients with acute and chronic physical disease and evaluated their association with depressive symptoms. 177 subjects with and without chronic medical comorbidity (factor: chronic physical disease) admitted to the trauma and orthopaedic surgery ward for a surgical intervention (factor: acute physical disease) were included in the analysis. Chronic medical comorbidity was scored using Charlson Index and depressive and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, factor: mental health). The effect of covariates was also evaluated. C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) and phenylalanine/tyrosine (PHE/TYR) were analysed by HPLC or ELISA prior to surgery and at discharge. Mixed Model as well as correlation analyses were performed.

Evidence regarding a shared pathophysiology suggests a mediating role by chronic systemic inflammation. The aims of this study were to measure the association between anxiety and depressive symptoms, cardiovascular risk factors, and inflammatory markers. Outpatients aged 40 years or more undergoing colonoscopy after positive fecal occult blood test were enrolled; the following data were collected: body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid profile, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, carotid thickness, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Temperament and Character Inventory, INTERdisciplinary MEDicine Self-Assessment, and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores. Fifty-four patients were enrolled; 30.2% had anxiety symptoms, 18.9% depressive symptoms, and 9.4% concomitant anxiety-depressive symptoms. Anxiety symptoms were associated with low high-density lipoprotein levels. Depressive symptoms were associated with CRP levels, providing supporting evidence for the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of depression.']},\n",

Biological measures may provide greater precision in many cases and may capture clinically-relevant inflammatory signposts, such as central obesity risk, inflammation-associated co-morbid medical conditions, or proinflammatory lifestyle choices.

Our model includes chronic conditions and lifestyle behaviors associated with clinically elevated inflammation in mood disorders. Elements of this \"inflamed depression\" model include: obesity, low HDL concentrations, elevated triglyceride concentrations, chronically elevated blood pressure, clinical diagnosis of hypothyroidism, migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, adult onset diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, inflammatory skin conditions, and lifestyle factors including smoking cigarettes and chronic stress.']},\n",

The possibility of antidepressants, particularly fluoxetine, for potential repurposing to treat primary progressive and secondary progressive MS is of interest as a result of the relative lack of disease-modifying medications for these subtypes. A number of animal studies have found positive results for a neuroprotective effect of antidepressant use in MS, with human studies showing mixed results. These human studies all have a significant limitation: they exclude people with moderate to severe depressive symptoms, a core symptom of MS beyond that of reactive depression. It is likely that reregulation of the common mechanisms in depression and MS, such as inflammation, serotonin, norepinephrine, glutamate and brain-derived neurotropic factor disruption, and hypothalamic-pituitary-thalamic axis dysregulation, are important to the neuroprotective value of antidepressant medication. Given that MS is known for its heterogeneity, the question might be less about whether antidepressant medication provides neuroprotective benefits to people with multiple sclerosis but for whom they provide benefits and whether we are designing studies that will detect a benefit. To answer these questions, studies must include people with MS and depressive symptoms as well as people with relapsing remitting and chronic subtypes.']},\n",

Findings both during and after treatment demonstrated the efficacy of yoga to improve overall quality of life (QOL), with improvement in subdomains of QOL varying across studies. Fatigue was the most commonly measured outcome, and most RCTs conducted during or after cancer treatment reported improvements in fatigue. Results also suggested that yoga can improve stress/distress during treatment and post-treatment disturbances in sleep and cognition. Several RCTs provided evidence that yoga may improve biomarkers of stress, inflammation, and immune function. Outcomes with limited or mixed findings (eg, anxiety, depression, pain, cancer-specific symptoms, such as lymphedema) and positive psychological outcomes (such as benefit-finding and life satisfaction) warrant further study. Important future directions for yoga research in oncology include: enrolling participants with cancer types other than breast, standardizing self-report assessments, increasing the use of active control groups and objective measures, and addressing the heterogeneity of yoga interventions, which vary in type, key components (movement, meditation, breathing), dose, and delivery mode.']},\n",

This study was aimed to evaluate the anti-depressant-like effect of hesperidin on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mice. Depressive-like behavior was detected by the sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). A 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to assess the cell viability of corticosterone-induced PC12\\u202fcells. The serum, hippocampal and cell supernatant concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) commercial kits. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE)/NF-κB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) pathway in the hippocampus and corticosterone-induced PC12\\u202fcells were detected by Western blot. Our results showed that hesperidin (100, 200\\u202fmg/kg) significantly relieved depressive-like behaviors, including decreased sucrose consumption in sucrose preference test (SPT), immobility in the forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test, and locomotor activity in the open field test (OFT). Hesperidin reduced inflammatory cytokine levels by attenuating the HMGB1/RAGE/NF-κB signaling pathway and BDNF/TrkB pathway both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, hesperidin possessed efficient neuroprotective effects on depression, which was associated with neuroinflammation mediated by the HMGB1/RAGE/NF-κB and BDNF/TrkB pathways.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Chronic stress is a major factor contributing to male infertility. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that resveratrol or dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions. Our study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of resveratrol or DMF against testicular dysfunction associated with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression in rats. Rats were subjected to 8 weeks of CUMS to induce depressive-like symptoms. CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviours in rats were evidenced by increased serum corticosterone levels and decreased serum and hippocampal serotonin levels as well as decreased hippocampal BDNF levels. CUMS significantly reduced sucrose preference and increased immobility time in stressed rats. Furthermore, CUMS exposure resulted in a significant decrease in serum testosterone levels and testicular expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (CYP450scc) enzyme and C-kit. CUMS significantly decreased and increased testicular expression of β-catenin and GSK-3β, respectively. CUMS also resulted in a significant increase in testicular expression of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-Iβ, and Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression levels. CUMS increased testicular MDA levels and significantly decreased testicular GSH and serum total antioxidant capacity levels. The histopathological results provided evidence for the biochemical and molecular analyses. All of these effects were significantly ameliorated by the administration of resveratrol or DMF. In conclusion, our study reveals that resveratrol or DMF exert profound testicular protective effects in CUMS rats that are mediated in part by suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis leading to the upregulation of serum testosterone levels, and testicular StAR, CYP450scc, c-kit and β-catenin levels.']},\n",

Animals were subjected to chronic restraint stress (3\\u202fh/day for 21\\u202fdays) to induce a depressive-like model. Sericin was administered at different doses (100, 150, and 200\\u202fmg/kg/day, gavage for 21\\u202fdays) along with immobilization. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) were performed to assess anxiety; while, the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were implemented to evaluate depressive-like behaviors. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and markers of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis were evaluated in the PFC and HIP regions. Moreover, serum levels of corticosterone were measured. Results showed that sericin increased number of central entries in OFT and prolonged time spent in open arms of EPM apparatus, while it reduced immobility time in TST and FST. Moreover, sericin treatments decreased oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation levels, restored MMP, and enhanced total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and enzyme activity of GPx and SOD in both brain regions. Furthermore, sericin reduced serum corticosterone concentration and suppressed neuroinflammatory response in the HIP and PFC, shown by decreased NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β protein levels. Finally, sericin inhibited mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway through down-regulation of Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-9 and -3, and up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein. These findings provide evidence for the protective effect of sericin therapy against psychopathological and behavioral changes induced by restraint stress.']},\n",

These are thought to be responsible for the potential effects of statins on various psychiatric disorders. In this study, we comprehensively review the literature to investigate the effects of statins on various psychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and dementia. In addition, we review adverse effects and drug interactions of statins to give clinically useful information guiding statin use in the psychiatric field. Statins seem useful in reducing depression, particularly in patients with physical disorders such as cardiovascular disease. In patients with schizophrenia, negative symptoms may be reduced by adjuvant statin therapy. Studies on cohorts at risk for dementia have generally shown protective effects of statins, while those on treatment for dementia show inconsistent results. In conclusion, statins used in combination with conventional psychotropic medications may be effective for various psychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and dementia.

Postpartum depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in new mothers and negatively affect offspring's cognitive development through mechanisms which are still unclear. Here, using a rat model, we manipulated the maternal social environment during lactation and explored the pathways through which social isolation (vs. the opportunity for limited social interaction with another lactating female, from 1 day before parturition to postpartum day 16) and chronic social conflict (daily exposure to a male intruder from postpartum day 2 to day 16) affect offspring learning and memory, measured at 40 to 60 days of age. We specifically explored the consequences of these social treatments on two main hypothesized mediators likely to affect offspring neurophysiological development: the quality of maternal care and maternal inflammation factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor) likely to influence offspring development through lactation. Maternal rats which had the opportunity to interact with another lactating female spent more time with their pups which, in turn, displayed improved working and reference memory. Social stress affected maternal plasma levels of cytokines that were associated with cognitive deficits in their offspring. However, females subjected to social stress were protected from these stress-induced immune changes and associated offspring cognitive impairment by increased social affiliation. These results underscore the effects of social interaction for new mothers and their offspring and can be used to inform the development of clinical preventative measures and interventions.\"]},\n",

Previous studies have indicated that activation of glial cells, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and dysregulation of adrenergic system in the central nervous system (CNS) could be the key mediators to modulate depression-related behaviors after peripheral immune activation. Central α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) has a role in the regulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. The present study determined the effects of PNU120596, α7 nAChR positive allosteric modulator (PAM), on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced anxiety, cognitive deficit, and depression-like behaviors in mice. These behaviors were evaluated 24\\u2009h after LPS (1\\u2009mg/kg) administration using elevated plus-maze, Y-maze, and forced swim test, respectively. The effects of PNU120596 on mRNA of neuroinflammatory markers and norepinephrine (NE) level in behaviorally-relevant brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were examined. PNU120596 administration (1 or 4\\u2009mg/kg) showed anxiolytic, pro-cognitive, and antidepressant-like effects by preventing LPS-induced behavioral abnormalities. Following LPS treatment, PNU120596 hindered activation markers of the microglia and astrocytes (cluster of differentiation molecule 11b and glial fibrillary acidic protein) and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. NE level that was reduced by peripheral LPS challenge was normalized by PNU120596 effects in both brain regions. Overall, the results in this study indicate that activation of α7 nAChR by PAM effectively prevents LPS-induced anxiety, cognitive deficit, and depression-like behaviors and regulates relevant neuroinflammatory markers in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.']},\n",

The MDD can be both primary and substance-induced and its accurate diagnosis represents a challenge for clinical practice and treatment response. Recent studies reported alterations in the circulating expression of inflammatory mediators in patients with psychiatric disorders, including those related to substance use. The aim of the study was to explore TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL12, CCL2, CCL11 (eotaxin-1) and CX3CL1 (fractalkine) as potential biomarkers to identify comorbid MDD and to distinguish primary MDD from substance-induced MDD in patients with substance disorders. Patients diagnosed with cocaine (CUD, n = 64) or alcohol (AUD, n = 65) use disorders with/without MDD were recruited from outpatient treatment programs [CUD/non-MDD (n = 31); CUD/primary MDD (n = 18); CUD/cocaine-induced MDD (N = 15); AUD/non-MDD (n = 27); AUD/primary MDD (n = 16) and AUD/alcohol-induced MDD (n = 22)]. Sixty-two healthy subjects were also recruited as control group. Substance and mental disorders were assessed according to \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision\" (DSM-IV-TR) and a blood sample was collected for determinations in the plasma. The cocaine group showed lower TNF-α (p<0.05) and CCL11 (p<0.05), and higher IL-1β (p<0.01) concentrations than the control group. In contrast, the alcohol group showed higher IL-1β (p<0.01) and lower CXCL12 (p<0.01) concentrations than the control group. Regarding MDD, we only observed alterations in the cocaine group. Thus, CUD/MDD patients showed lower IL-1β (p<0.05), CXCL12 (p<0.05) and CCL11 (p<0.05), and higher CXC3CL1 (p<0.05) concentrations than CUD/non-MDD patients. Moreover, while CUD/primary MDD patients showed higher CCL11 (p<0.01) concentrations than both CUD/non-MDD and CUD/cocaine-induced MDD patients, CUD/cocaine-induced MDD patients showed lower CXCL12 (p<0.05) concentrations than CUD/non-MDD patients. Finally, a logistic regression model in the cocaine group identified CXCL12, CCL11 and sex to distinguish primary MDD from cocaine-induced MDD providing a high discriminatory power. The present data suggest an association between changes in inflammatory mediators and the diagnosis of primary and substance-induced MDD, namely in CUD patients.']},\n",

The aim was to investigate the feasibility of such a program in patients awaiting LT. Patients were randomly selected from the Birmingham LT waiting list and provided with a 12-week HBEP, including average daily step (ADS) targets and twice-weekly resistance exercises. Feasibility was based on patient eligibility (≥66% of waiting list), target recruitment (≥90% of n\\xa0=\\xa020), safety (no related serious adverse events), and adherence (≥66% adherence to 6-week HBEP). Measures of aerobic (incremental shuttle walk test [ISWT], ADS), functional capacity (short physical performance battery test [SPPBT]), and health-related quality of life (EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) and hospital anxiety and depression score [HADS]) were taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks. 18 patients (50% male; median age, 55 years) were recruited. All domains of the study feasibility criteria were met. ISWT improved after 6 weeks (50 m; P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01) and 12 weeks (210 m; P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01), despite withdrawal of the telephone health calls.

In conclusion, a 12-week HBEP, incorporating both easy-to-apply resistance and aerobic exercises, is safe and feasible in patients awaiting LT.

       "  'abstract': ['The interplay of chronic stress, neuroinflammation and altered immune reactivity has been shown to be important for the pathophysiology of brain disorders such as schizophrenia, depressive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. This immuno-inflammatory theory has been extensively studied in the past three decades leading to the formation of the integrative discipline of psychoneuroimmunology. Targeting of the central nervous system by conventional pharmacotherapeutic methods is mainly through modulation of neuroendocrine systems such as the dopaminergic, GABA-ergic, adrenergic and serotoninergic systems. In recent years an increasing number of both experimental and clinical studies have shown that antidepressants can affect the immune system by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. However, due to the serious adverse effects accompanying the chronic administration of psychoactive drugs there is a continuous need to produce novel therapeutics that are both potent and safe. The present review aims to summarize the current knowledge in the field of psychoneuroimmunology and to delineate the main interactions between stress, inflammation, immunity and the brain. Additionally, this paper explores the use of plant-derived molecules that display a strong anti-stress effect and simultaneously modulate the immune response as an alternative or adjuvant to classical antidepressant drugs.']},\n",

The purpose of this study was to use blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI to explore changes in the resting-state brain activity in a rat model of depression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1\\u2009mg/kg) challenge and to examine whether acute ketamine administration can reverse LPS-induced depressive-like behavior. Here, we showed LPS-induced depressive-like behavior as evidenced by significantly reduced motility in the forced swim test. In addition, LPS-induced increases in plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines were not completely reversed by acute ketamine administration, suggesting that ketamine exerts its antidepressant effects independently of a possible interference with LPS-induced inflammatory signaling. However, increased regional homogeneity (ReHo) was observed in some brain regions of LPS-exposed animals, including bilateral caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens, which were parts of the mood-regulating circuit. Moreover, ReHo values of bilateral caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens showed significant positive correlations with immobility time. Notably, the LPS-induced depressive-like behavior and increase of ReHo value in the right nucleus accumbens was reversed by acute ketamine administration. In summary, this study suggests that acute ketamine administration is capable of attenuating LPS-induced depressive-like behavior, at least partially by reversing abnormal ReHo in the right nucleus accumbens.']},\n",

MS is often accompanied by psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder (MDD), which presents a lifetime prevalence of around 50% in MS patients. Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model extensively used to study MS. EAE mimics the autoimmune nature of MS, as well as its inflammatory and demyelinating mechanisms also presenting predictive validity. There are important similarities between EAE and MS-associated depression (MSD). The mechanisms shared by these disorders include peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunctions, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, lowered antioxidant defenses, increased bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation, and microglial pathology. Although the role of the immune-inflammatory system in MDD has been established in the 1990's, only few studies addressed immune pathways as a major determinant of depressive-like behavior in EAE. Therefore, in the present study we aimed at revising the current literature on EAE as an animal model to investigate the comorbidity between MS and MDD. In this regard, we revised the current literature on behavioral alterations in EAE, the possible mechanisms involved in this comorbidity and the potential and limitations of using this animal model to study depressive-like behavior.\"]},\n",

The present study was designed to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects and mechanisms of baicalin on olfactory bulbectomized model of depression. Baicalin treatment (20 and 40\\xa0mg/kg) significantly reversed the abnormal levels of sucrose consumption, open field test, and forced swimming test. Treatments with baicalin reversed the olfactory bulbectomized-induced alterations of serum corticosterone levels to a great extent. Our results further demonstrated that baicalin administration negatively regulated the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Furthermore, baicalin regulated Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and decreased the levels of p65 acetylation (ac-p65) in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Moreover, in lipopolysaccharides-induced BV-2 cells, the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β), p65 acetylation at lysine 310, and SIRT1 expression were different in the group treated with both baicalin and nicotinamide compared with the group treated with baicalin, which suggests that baicalin regulates SIRT1 and thereby inhibits p65 acetylation. In summary, administration of baicalin reduces the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, possibly through regulation of SIRT1-NF-kB pathway. Our findings suggest a support into the potential of baicalin in therapeutic effect for depression.']},\n",

Evidence points to an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response resulting from peripheral systemic inflammation after surgery, with subsequent cytokine-induced glutamatergic excitotoxicity and synaptic impairment. These immunological changes, among many others, are also observed in Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist commonly used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Surprisingly, little research exists on the role of memantine in preventing POCD. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of memantine on a spectrum of cognitive functions postoperatively. Mice were divided into 3 groups and each received treatment for 4 weeks. Placebo groups received a placebo then underwent either a sham procedure or a laparotomy procedure. The memantine group received memantine hydrochloride then underwent a laparotomy procedure. Cognitive tests were performed on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 7. Compared to sham-operated mice, placebo groups that underwent a laparotomy procedure showed impaired memory in the Morris water maze test, higher anxiety-like behavior in the open field and the elevated plus maze tests, increased depression-like behavior in the tail suspension test, and lack of preference for social novelty in the three-chamber test. On the other hand, memantine-treated mice that underwent a laparotomy procedure showed enhanced memory on POD7, improved depression-like behavior on POD1 and POD7, enhanced preference for social novelty on POD1, and no improvement in anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest a potential protective effect of memantine in mice postoperatively on memory, depression-like behavior, and preference for social novelty.\"]},\n",

'Excito-toxic' and 'neuro-protective' metabolites are produced, which modulate the glutamatergic neurotransmission. The TRY/CAT pathway is activated by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal endocrine induction during stress by corticoids hormones, and the excitotoxic branch of the TRY/CAT pathway is activated by proinflammatory cytokines. During stress and major depressive disorders, it is generally accepted that inflammation induces an imbalance toward the excitotoxic branch of the TRY/CAT pathway, causing changes in brain connectivity in corticolimbic structures and therefore psychocognitive abnormalities. In neurodegenerative diseases, the activation of the oxidative branch of the TRY/CAT pathway has been frequently reported. We propose a comprehensive survey of the TRY/CAT pathway (kynurenine pathway) abnormalities in stress and inflammation-induced MDD and neurodegenerative diseases. As TRY/CAT pathway is a common feature of stress, inflammation, affective disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, we discuss the status of the TRY/CAT pathway as a possible link among chronic stress, inflammation, depressive disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. This review does not claim to be exhaustive, but in a pharmacological perspective, it will be proposed that modulation of the excitotoxicity/neuroprotection balance is a valuable strategy for new and more effective treatments of mood disorders.\"]},\n",

The fact that exercise is sensed by the brain suggests that muscle-induced peripheral factors enable direct crosstalk between muscle and brain function. Muscle secretes myokines that contribute to the regulation of hippocampal function. Evidence is accumulating that the myokine cathepsin B passes through the blood-brain barrier to enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor production and hence neurogenesis, memory and learning. Exercise increases neuronal gene expression of FNDC5 (which encodes the PGC1α-dependent myokine FNDC5), which can likewise contribute to increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Serum levels of the prototype myokine, IL-6, increase with exercise and might contribute to the suppression of central mechanisms of feeding. Exercise also increases the PGC1α-dependent muscular expression of kynurenine aminotransferase enzymes, which induces a beneficial shift in the balance between the neurotoxic kynurenine and the neuroprotective kynurenic acid, thereby reducing depression-like symptoms. Myokine signalling, other muscular factors and exercise-induced hepatokines and adipokines are implicated in mediating the exercise-induced beneficial impact on neurogenesis, cognitive function, appetite and metabolism, thus supporting the existence of a muscle-brain endocrine loop.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Chronic exposure to stress is associated with increased incidence of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. However, stress induces vulnerability to such disorders only in a sub-population of individuals, as others remain resilient. Inflammation has emerged as a putative mechanism for promoting stress vulnerability. Using a rodent model of social defeat, we have previously shown that rats with short-defeat latencies (SL/vulnerable rats) show increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and these behaviors are mediated by inflammation in the ventral hippocampus. The other half of socially defeated rats show long-latencies to defeat (LL/resilient) and are similar to controls. Because gut microbiota are important activators of inflammatory substances, we assessed the role of the gut microbiome in mediating vulnerability to repeated social defeat stress. We analyzed the fecal microbiome of control, SL/vulnerable, and LL/resilient rats using shotgun metagenome sequencing and observed increased expression of immune-modulating microbiota, such as Clostridia, in SL/vulnerable rats. We then tested the importance of gut microbiota to the SL/vulnerable phenotype. In otherwise naive rats treated with microbiota from SL/vulnerable rats, there was higher microglial density and IL-1β expression in the vHPC, and higher depression-like behaviors relative to rats that received microbiota from LL/resilient rats, non-stressed control rats, or vehicle-treated rats. However, anxiety-like behavior during social interaction was not altered by transplant of the microbiome of SL/vulnerable rats into non-stressed rats. Taken together, the results suggest the gut microbiome contributes to the depression-like behavior and inflammatory processes in the vHPC of stress vulnerable individuals.']},\n",

A diverse sample of adolescents representative of an urban community (N\\u202f=\\u202f129; Age at baseline\\u202f=\\u202f12.5\\u202fyears; 48.8% female; 55.0% African American) completed measures of stressful life events, depressive symptoms, and two annual blood draws (BD1 and BD2). Controlling for inflammatory activity at BD1, depression at BD1, demographics and the time between assessments, increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6; b\\u202f=\\u202f0.878, p\\u202f=\\u202f.007) and C-reactive protein (CRP; b\\u202f=\\u202f0.252, p\\u202f=\\u202f.024) from BD1 to BD2 interacted with recent stressful life events before BD1 to predict severity of depressive symptoms at BD2. Similar associations were evident for IL-6 (b\\u202f=\\u202f2.074, p\\u202f=\\u202f.040) and CRP (b\\u202f=\\u202f0.919, p\\u202f=\\u202f.050) when considering acute stressful life events that had occurred within the two weeks before the first blood collection. More frequent stressful life events before BD1 predicted significantly more severe depressive symptoms at BD2, but only for adolescents with moderate (50th percentile) and high (84th percentile) levels of IL-6 and CRP at BD2. In conclusion, adolescents who experienced both recent stressful life events and larger increases in inflammatory activity following these stressors were at increased risk for more severe depressive symptoms after approximately one year. The findings indicate that the interaction of stress and larger changes in inflammatory activity following these stressors are prognostic risk factors for depression severity in adolescents.']},\n",

Adiponectin is produced by adipose tissue and exerts anti-inflammatory activities. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating adiponectin levels in BD patients and healthy controls. Electronic databases were searched from their inception until 15th Jan 2019. Random-effects models with the Hedges' g as the effect size (ES) estimate were used. We included 11 studies, representing 477 patients and 380 controls. Pooled data analysis revealed no significant differences in adiponectin levels between BD patients and controls (ES\\u2009=\\u20090.28, 95%CI: -0.34 - 0.90, p\\u2009=\\u20090.372).

The levels of adiponectin in depressed patients were lower, but this result did not reach statistical significance (ES = -0.90, 95%CI: -1.85 - 0.05, p\\u2009=\\u20090.063). Due to low number of studies, the subgroup analysis of manic patients was not performed; however, a severity of manic symptoms was not associated with the ES estimates. Longer illness duration and a higher percentage of BD type I (BD-I) patients were associated with higher ES estimates. A higher severity of depressive symptoms was associated with lower ES estimates. Heterogeneity was significant in all analyses. Results of the Egger's test were insignificant, showing no publication bias. Our results indicate that adiponectin might be a state marker of BD as it appears to be elevated in euthymia and decreased in depression. Illness progression and a diagnosis of BD-I might contribute to higher adiponectin levels.\"]},\n",

Due to the retention of uremic toxins, electrolytes and water, and the resultant metabolic disturbances, CKD affects several organs, including the nervous system. Thus, CKD patients suffer from several neurological complications, including dementia, cognitive impairment, motor abnormalities, depression, and mood and sleep disturbances. However, the mechanisms underlying the neurological complications are least elucidated. We have recently reported a highly reproducible mice model of CKD induced by high adenine diet, which exhibited psychomotor behavioral abnormalities and blood-brain barrier disruption. In the present study, using the mice model, we have investigated psycho-motor and cognitive behaviour, and the neurochemical and histopathological alterations in brain relevant to the observed behavioural abnormalities. The results demonstrate global loss of Acetylcholinesterase activity, and decrease in neuronal arborisation and dendritic spine density in discrete brain regions, of the CKD mice. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunctions were found in specific brain regions of the mice, which have been regarded as the underlying causes of the observed neurochemical and histopathological alterations. Thus, the present study is of immense importance, and has therapeutic implications in the management of CKD-associated neurological complications.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Prolonged or excessive stress may induce emotional and cognitive disturbances, and is a risk factor for mental illnesses. Using rodent chronic stress models of depression, roles of multiple lipid mediators related to inflammation have been revealed in chronic stress-induced emotional alterations. Prostaglandin (PG) E2, an arachidonic acid (AA)-derived lipid mediator, and its receptor subtype EP1 mediate depression-like behavior induced by repeated social defeat stress through attenuating prefrontal dopaminergic activity. Repeated social defeat stress activates microglia through innate immune receptors, and induces PGE2 synthesis through cyclooxygenase-1, a prostaglandin synthase enriched in microglia. PGD2, another AA-derived lipid mediator, has been implicated in depression induced by chronic stress, although either pro-depressive or anti-depressive actions have been reported. Chronic stress up-regulates hippocampal expression of 5-lipoxygenase, hence synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, thereby inducing depression through their receptors. Consistent with beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids in the diet of depressive patients, resolvins-a novel class of pro-resolving lipid mediators-in the brain attenuate neuroinflammation-associated depression. These findings in animal models of depression offer lipid mediators and related molecules as novel therapeutic targets for treating depression. To translate these findings into clinics, translational biomarkers to visualize lipid mediator profiles in depressive patients need to be established.']},\n",

Evidence is mounting on the causal role of an altered gut microbiome in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and diabetes, and psychiatric diseases like anxiety and depression. Mechanisms include altered energy harvest from food, hormonal changes, increased gut permeability, inflammation, immune response, and a direct influence on the brain and behavior. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the third most common disease in adolescence and exacts a high burden on patients and caregivers. It often becomes chronic and has the highest mortality of all psychiatric diseases. As AN is characterized by nutritional restrictions, weight loss, and severe behavioral symptoms including weight phobia, comorbid anxiety and depression, accompanied by endocrine alterations, increased inflammation, and immune response, exploring the role of the gut microbiome is crucial. Here, we present an overview of the potential mechanisms of interaction between the gut microbiome, the host and particularly the brain in AN and summarize the initial findings of microbiome research on AN. We conclude by identifying future research directions and potential therapeutic approaches, including nutritional interventions, probiotics, prebiotics and food supplements, that could become important additions to current AN therapy.']},\n",

Some peripherally produced cytokines, such as TNF-α, can cross the blood brain barrier and result in activation of brain microglia which produces additional TNF-α and fosters a cascade of events including decreases in markers of synaptic plasticity and increases in neurodegenerative events. This is exemplified by preclinical studies, which show that peripheral administration of pro-inflammatory cytokines can elicit depression-like behavior. Importantly, this depression-like behavior can be ameliorated by anti-cytokine therapies. Work in our laboratory suggests that TNF-α is particularly important for the development of a depressive phenotype and that TNF-α antagonists might have promise as novel antidepressant drugs. Future research should examine rates of inflammation at baseline in depressed patients and whether anti-inflammatory agents could be included as part of the treatment regimen for depressive disorders.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Incensole and its acetate have shown anti-inflammatory and anti-depression activities due to their ability to activate ion channels in the brain to alleviate anxiety or depression. The natural occurrence of these two structurally and medicinally fascinating 14-membered diterpenoids was reported mainly from the genus Boswellia. Incensole and incensole acetate were detected in and isolated from both essential oils and resins of frankincense. One total synthesis was reported for incensole. Both incensole and its acetate served as precursors for several synthetic transformations. Given the fact that no specific enzymes were isolated from Boswellia trees, the major sources for incensole and incensole acetate, the biosynthetic pathway of these two compounds was only speculated. Recent studies on incensole and incensole acetate including ours have revealed another secret of the ancient drug. Understanding their mode of action will open a door in modern neurobiology and provides new insights on the mysterious diseases of the nervous system. This review interpretatively discusses the natural existence of incensole and incensole acetate, the variation of their percentages in different Boswellia species and other sources, their synthetic modifications, their biosynthesis and their therapeutic potential.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': [\"Patients suffering from neuropathic pain have a higher incidence of depression and cognitive decline. Although environment enrichment (EE) may be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain, the precise mechanisms underlying its actions remain determined. The aim of the study was to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the EE's beneficial effects in mice with neuropathic pain. EE attenuated the pain threshold reduction, depression-like phenotype, and memory deficit in mice after chronic constriction injury (CCI). Furthermore, EE attenuated decreased neurogenesis and increased inflammation in the hippocampus of mice with neuropathic pain after CCI. Moreover, the suppression of adult hippocampal neurogenesis by temozolomide antagonized the beneficial effects of EE on depression-like phenotype and cognitive deficit in the mice with neuropathic pain. In addition, lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the hippocampus antagonized the beneficial effects of EE for these behavioral abnormalities in mice with neuropathic pain. Knock-down of NPAS4 (neuronal PAS domain protein 4) in the hippocampus by lentivirus targeting NPAS4 blocked these beneficial effects of EE in the mice with neuropathic pain. These all findings suggest that hippocampal NPAS4 plays a key role in the beneficial effects of EE on the pain sensitivity, depression-like phenotype, and memory deficit in mice with neuropathic pain. Therefore, it is likely that NPAS4 would be a new therapeutic target for perceptional, affective, and cognitive dimensions in patients with chronic pain.\"]},\n",

This study investigated the effect of the decoction Xiaoyaosan (XYS) against depressive behavior through the regulation of intestinal flora. Fifty-two healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (i.e., control, model, XYS, and fluoxetine). The latter three groups were subjected to 21 days of chronic restraint stress to produce the stress depression model. Rats in the XYS and fluoxetine groups received intragastric administration of XYS and fluoxetine, respectively. The behavioral changes of the rats were observed after 21 days. Stool specimens were sequenced using the 16S rDNA high-throughput method to detect the structure and changes in intestinal flora. There was no difference observed in alpha diversity among the groups. At the phylum level, XYS regulated the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes. At the genus level, XYS reduced the abundance of the Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, and Desulfovibrio. On the contrary, it increased the abundance of the Ruminococcaceae family to improve depression-like behavior. The mechanism involved in this process may be related to short-chain fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides, and intestinal inflammation.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Depression is a frequent comorbidity of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Depression and diabetes are linked by a bidirectional relationship, but the underlying mechanisms are still incompletely understood. Experimental, observational and intervention studies showed that inflammatory processes contribute to the development of depression in animal models and humans. Given the high risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with the double burden of diabetes and depression, this review provides an overview of epidemiological studies that addressed the relationship between biomarkers of inflammation and depressive symptoms or depression in diabetes patients. In patients with T1D, there is some evidence that higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and sICAM-1 may be related to depressive symptoms or (for hsCRP) lower treatment response. For T2D, hsCRP, IL-1RA, CCL2 and adiponectin or its isoforms were associated with depressive symptoms in at least two studies, whereas positive associations of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-18 with depressive symptoms or depression were reported from single cohorts. However, the number of studies is too low for any meaningful meta-analysis. Prospective life course studies including both patients with T1D and T2D, a comprehensive assessment of systemic inflammation and repeated assessment of depressive symptoms should represent a future research priority to clarify to what extent subclinical inflammation affects the risk of depression in patients with diabetes. A better understanding of the role of inflammatory processes may help to identify subtypes of depression with partly different pathogenesis, which could have consequences with respect to therapeutic options including immunomodulation.']},\n",

Accelerating progress towards reducing stunting requires a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to linear growth faltering. We conducted path analyses of factors associated with 18-month length-for-age z-score (LAZ) in four prospective cohorts of children who participated in trials conducted as part of the International Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements Project in Ghana (n=1039), Malawi (n=684\\u2009and 1504) and Burkina Faso (n=2619). In two cohorts, women were enrolled during pregnancy. In two other cohorts, infants were enrolled at 6 or 9 months. We examined the association of 42 indicators of environmental, maternal, caregiving and child factors with 18-month LAZ. Using structural equation modelling, we examined direct and indirect associations through hypothesised mediators in each cohort. Out of 42 indicators, 2 were associated with 18-month LAZ in three or four cohorts: maternal height and body mass index (BMI). Six factors were associated with 18-month LAZ in two cohorts: length for gestational age z-score (LGAZ) at birth, pregnancy duration, improved household water, child dietary diversity, diarrhoea incidence and 6-month or 9-month haemoglobin concentration. Direct associations were more prevalent than indirect associations, but 30%-62% of the associations of maternal height and BMI with 18-month LAZ were mediated by LGAZ at birth. Factors that were not associated with LAZ were maternal iron status, illness and inflammation during pregnancy, maternal stress and depression, exclusive breast feeding during 6 months post partum, feeding frequency and child fever, malaria and acute respiratory infections. These findings may help in identifying interventions to accelerate progress towards reducing stunting; however, much of the variance in linear growth status remained unaccounted for by these 42 individual-level factors, suggesting that community-level changes may be needed to achieve substantial progress.\"]},\n",

The influences of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on neuroinflammation associated depression-like behavior have not been investigated yet, and associated biochemical changes are currently unclear. Therefore, we assessed the effects of NAC on neuroinflammation associated depression-like behavior induced through chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats. The antidepressant-like effect of NAC was depicted using the sucrose preference test and the forced swimming test (FST) while CUMS-induced alteration in the locomotor index was measured using the open field test (OFT) and actophotometer. Our results revealed that CUMS exposure markedly aggravated depression-like behavior, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and reduced the serotonin levels. One-week consecutive NAC (50 and 100\\u2009mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (10\\u2009mg/kg, p.o., a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) treatment significantly increased sucrose preference index, reduced immobility time in the FST, and the increased the number of squares crossed, number of rearing in the OFT and locomotion in the actophotometer in the CUMS-exposed rats. Moreover, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus as well as pre-frontal cortex were suppressed, and remarkably restored the serotonin levels by NAC (50 and 100\\u2009mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (10\\u2009mg/kg, p.o.) administration. However, NAC (25\\u2009mg/kg, p.o.) exerted insignificant protection against CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior and associated neuro-inflammation. This study demonstrates that NAC exhibited the antidepressant-like effect in the CUMS-exposed rats, which might be mediated by anti-inflammatory potential and restoring serotonergic responses in the stressed rats.']},\n",

The aims of the present review are first to provide some historical background and to consider the evidence in favor of the claim that inflammation is causally involved in major depression. The second part discusses some of the possibilities allowed for by the use of broad 'umbrella' concepts, such as inflammation and stress, in terms of proposing new working hypotheses and potential mechanisms. The third part reviews proposed biomarkers of inflammation and depression and the final part addresses how elements discussed in the preceding sections are used in immunopsychiatry. The 'umbrella' concepts of inflammation and stress, as well as insufficiently-met criteria based inferences and reverse inferences are being used to some extent in immunopsychiatry. The field is therefore encouraged to specify concepts and constructs, as well as to consider potential alternative interpretations and explanations for findings obtained. The hope is that pointing out some of the potential problems will allow for a clearer picture of immunopsychiatry's current strengths and limitations and help the field mature.\"]},\n",

An increasing number of clinical studies now hypothesize that latent toxoplasmosis may be a risk factor for the development of psychiatric disease. For depression, the results have been varied and we speculate that genetic background is important for the response to latent toxoplasmosis. The main objective of this study was to elucidate gene - environment interactions in the behavioural response to TOX infection by use of genetically vulnerable animals (Flinders sensitive line, FSL) compared to control animals (Flinders resistant line, FRL). Our results show that all infected animals displayed increased anxiety-like behaviour whereas only genetically vulnerable animals (FSL rats) showed depressive-like behaviour as a consequence of the TOX infection. Furthermore, peripheral cytokine expression was increased following the infection, primarily independent of strain. In the given study 14 cytokines, chemokines, metabolic hormones, and growth factors were quantified with the bead-based Luminex200 system, however, only IL-1α expression was affected differently in FSL animals compared to FRL rats. These results suggest that latent TOX infection can induce anxiety-like behaviour independent of genetic background. Intriguingly, we also report that for depressive-like behaviour only the vulnerable rat strain is affected. This could explain the discrepancy in the literature as to whether TOX infection is a risk factor for depressive symptomatology. We propose that the low grade inflammation caused by the chronic infection is related to the development of behavioural symptoms.']},\n",

       "  'abstract': ['Present antidepressant treatments are only helpful in a quarter of patients with bipolar depression, and new strategies are warranted. Increasing evidence suggests that accelerated polyamine metabolism is associated with the pathophysiology of depression. Polyamines regulate stress responses, inflammation, and neuronal signaling in the central and enteric nervous system. Agmatine is a promising target of altered polyamine metabolism considering its unique ability to regulate intracellular polyamine content and neuroprotective effects. Areas covered: This review discusses the polyamine system and its relationship to the central and enteric nervous system, focusing on results from preclinical studies supporting the relationship between agmatine and the pathophysiology of depression. We also discussed the main mechanisms underlying the antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of agmatine. Expert opinion: Our review points out the possible relationship between polyamines and the pathophysiology of depression. It discusses the efficacy of agmatine in several models of depressive-like behaviour, and suggests that it may prove to be an efficacious adjunctive treatment in bipolar depression. Furthermore, it discusses a proposed pathway linking systemic inflammation, observed in a subset of bipolar disorder patients, to abnormal polyamine metabolism and associated changes in the epithelial gut barrier and blood-brain barrier.']},\n",
